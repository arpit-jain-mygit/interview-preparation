## Problem Statement

A **rate limiter** controls the rate of traffic by limiting the number of requests allowed within a specific time period. If requests exceed the threshold, excess calls are blocked.

### Real-World Examples
- **Twitter**: 300 tweets per 3 hours
- **GitHub API**: 60 API calls per hour (unauthenticated)
- **Google Docs**: 300 per user per 60 seconds (read requests)

### Why Rate Limiting Matters

1. **Prevent DoS Attacks** - Block malicious users from overwhelming the system
2. **Reduce Costs** - Limit usage of paid third-party APIs
3. **Ensure Fair Usage** - Protect from resource starvation by individual users
4. **Maintain System Stability** - Prevent cascading failures during traffic spikes

---

## Testing Scenarios

We'll use **three consistent scenarios** to compare all algorithms:

### Scenario A: Web API Rate Limiting
```
Limit: 10 requests per minute per user
Pattern: 3 requests at T=0s, then 6s quiet, then 9 requests at T=9s
Context: Public REST API, bursty traffic expected
```

### Scenario B: Payment Processing
```
Limit: 50 transactions per minute per merchant
Pattern: 30 transactions steady, sudden burst of 40 at peak hour
Context: Critical system, errors expensive, need high accuracy
```

### Scenario C: Email Service
```
Limit: 1000 emails per hour per account
Pattern: 500 emails sent, quiet period, then 800 attempt
Context: Background processing, steady rate preferred
```

---

## Algorithm Comparison

### 1️⃣ Token Bucket Algorithm ⭐

#### How It Works

```
Concept: A bucket that refills with tokens at a fixed rate

Bucket capacity: 10 tokens
Refill rate: 1 token per second

Each request costs 1 token
- Token available? REQUEST ACCEPTED ✓
- No token? REQUEST REJECTED ✗
```

#### Using Scenario A (Web API)

```
Configuration: Bucket size = 10, Refill = 1 per second

T=0s:    3 requests arrive
         Tokens: 10 → 9 → 8 → 7
         Status: ✓ All accepted

T=1-6s:  Quiet period
         Tokens: 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 (refill during quiet)
         Status: Building reserve

T=9s:    9 requests arrive (burst!)
         Tokens: 10 available
         Requests 1-8: ✓ Accepted (8 tokens used)
         Request 9: ✗ Rejected (no tokens left)
         
Result: 8/9 accepted (89% success rate)
Latency: ~0ms (instant)
Memory: O(1) - just 1 counter
```

#### Advantages
✅ Handles burst traffic gracefully (reserves tokens during quiet)
✅ Simple to implement and understand
✅ Low memory footprint
✅ Industry standard (Amazon, Stripe, Google)

#### Limitations
❌ Hard to tune (bucket size vs refill rate)
❌ May cause unpredictable bursts if misconfigured
❌ Different configurations needed for different traffic patterns

#### When to Use
- **Best for**: Public APIs, web services, real-time systems
- **Examples**: Twitter API, GitHub API, Google Cloud APIs
- **Key requirement**: Burst traffic acceptable, low latency critical

#### Real-World Case: GitHub API
```
GitHub uses Token Bucket for rate limiting:
- 60 requests per hour (unauthenticated)
- 5000 requests per hour (authenticated)
- Allows bursts: Can send 60 req rapidly within the hour
```

---

### 2️⃣ Leaking Bucket Algorithm

#### How It Works

```
Concept: FIFO queue that drains at fixed rate

Queue capacity: 10 requests
Outflow rate: 1 request per 6 seconds

Process: Request added to queue if not full
         Requests processed at steady rate
```

#### Problems It Solves from Token Bucket
❌ Token Bucket: Unpredictable bursts can happen
✅ Leaking Bucket: **Guaranteed steady processing rate**

❌ Token Bucket: Hard to tune parameters
✅ Leaking Bucket: **Simple - just set queue size and rate**

#### Using Scenario C (Email Service)

```
Configuration: Queue = 100 emails, Outflow = 10/sec

T=0s:    500 emails queued
         Queue: [E1, E2, ..., E500]
         Status: Processing at 10/sec

T=50s:   Still processing (500/10 = 50 seconds)
         Queue draining steadily

T=120s:  Burst of 800 emails arrives
         Queue size = 100 max
         Accepted: 100 (fill remaining capacity)
         Rejected: 700
         
Result: 100/800 accepted (only 12.5%)
Wait time: Up to 10 seconds (100 emails × 1sec each)
Memory: O(1) - just queue size
```

#### Advantages
✅ Predictable, constant output rate
✅ Protects backend from spikes
✅ Memory efficient
✅ Fair processing (FIFO order)

#### Limitations
❌ **High latency** - Requests wait in queue (15-57 seconds possible)
❌ Poor user experience for web APIs
❌ Not suitable for real-time systems
❌ Can't handle sudden traffic spikes gracefully

#### When to Use
- **Best for**: Background jobs, batch processing, database protection
- **Examples**: Email queuing systems, Shopify API, job schedulers
- **Key requirement**: Steady processing rate more important than latency

#### Real-World Case: Shopify
```
Shopify uses Leaking Bucket approach:
- Maintains steady load on database
- Processes orders at predictable rate
- Accepts offline orders into queue
- Processes them when capacity available
```

### 3️⃣ Fixed Window Counter

#### How It Works

```
Concept: Divide time into equal windows, count requests per window

Window size: 1 minute
Limit: 10 requests per window

When window ends: Counter resets to 0
```

#### Problems It Solves
❌ Token Bucket: Parameters hard to tune
✅ Fixed Window: **Simple - just set window size and limit**

❌ Leaking Bucket: High latency issues
✅ Fixed Window: **O(1) response time, no queueing**

#### Problems It Creates
⚠️ **CRITICAL FLAW: Exploitable edge cases!**

#### Using Scenario A (Web API)

```
Configuration: Window = 1 minute, Limit = 10 requests

Normal usage:
T=0:00-0:01:  10 requests accepted, then rejected
T=1:00-1:01:  Fresh window, 10 more accepted

EXPLOIT at edge case:
T=0:59:       User sends 10 requests ✓
              Counter: 0 → 10/10

T=1:00:       WINDOW RESETS!

T=1:01:       User sends 10 MORE requests ✓
              Counter: 0 → 10/10

In actual time [0:59-1:01] = 2 minutes:
  Sent 20 requests! (2X the limit of 10/minute)
  
Result: EXPLOITED! 🚨
```

#### Advantages
✅ Extremely simple to implement
✅ O(1) time per request
✅ O(1) memory - just 1 counter

#### Limitations
❌ **Can allow 2X limit at window boundaries** (exploitable!)
❌ Not suitable for strict rate limiting
❌ Vulnerable to timing attacks
❌ Not secure for APIs

#### When to Use
- **Only for**: Non-critical quotas, internal APIs, informational limits
- **Examples**: "You viewed 100 articles today", "Free tier: 1000/month"
- **Key requirement**: Accuracy not critical, simplicity important

#### Real-World Case: NOT RECOMMENDED
```
Twitter initially used Fixed Window
Attackers exploited edge cases:
- Sent requests at 14:59:00
- Sent more requests at 15:00:00
- Achieved 2X rate limit in 60 seconds

Twitter switched to Sliding Window implementation
```

#### Security: How Attackers Exploit This

```
1. DISCOVERY (5 minutes):
   Send requests, observe when 429 errors stop appearing
   → Identify window boundary (e.g., every minute at :00)

2. EXPLOITATION (trivial):
   T=59:50: Send 10 requests (last 10 sec of window)
   T=60:00: Window resets!
   T=60:10: Send 10 more requests (first 10 sec of new window)
   
3. RESULT:
   In 20 seconds, sent 20 requests (2X limit!)
   Can repeat every minute for sustained attack

4. IMPACT:
   - API scraping: 4X faster
   - DDoS amplification: 2X attack power
   - Fraud: 2X password attempts
```

### 4️⃣ Sliding Window Log

#### How It Works

```
Concept: Keep timestamp of every request in rolling window

Store: All request timestamps (usually in Redis sorted set)
Check: Count timestamps in [now-60s, now]
Limit: If count < limit, accept and add timestamp
```

#### Problems It Solves from Fixed Window
❌ Fixed Window: Exploitable at boundaries
✅ Sliding Window Log: **No fixed boundaries, perfect accuracy!**

❌ Fixed Window: Can allow 2X limit
✅ Sliding Window Log: **Impossible to exceed limit in any rolling window**

#### Using Scenario B (Payment Processing)

```
Configuration: Window = 1 minute, Limit = 50 transactions

T=0:00:   Transaction T1 arrives
          Log: [0:00:00]
          Window [59:00-0:00]: 1 transaction ✓ Accept

T=0:30:   30 transactions arrive
          Log: [0:00, 0:30, 0:30, ...]
          Window [59:30-0:30]: 31 transactions < 50 ✓ Accept all

T=0:59:   19 more arrive
          Log: [0:00, 0:30x30, 0:59x19]
          Window [59:59-0:59]: 50 transactions = 50 ✓ Accept all

T=0:59:55: Burst of 40 arrives
          Log: [0:00, 0:30x30, 0:59x19, 0:59:55x40]
          Window [59:55-0:55]: 99 transactions >= 50 ✗ Reject 40

T=1:00:05: Some transactions now outside window
          Remove timestamps < 1:00:05
          Log now: [0:59x19, 0:59:55x40]
          Window [0:05-1:05]: 59 transactions >= 50 ✗ Still reject

Result: Burst rejected until oldest transactions expire
Memory: 100+ timestamps stored per user (expensive!)
```

#### Advantages
✅ **Perfect accuracy** - No edge cases, no exploits
✅ True rolling window - Respects actual time
✅ Secure - Impossible to game the system
✅ Fair - Everyone gets exactly their quota

#### Limitations
❌ **High memory cost** - Stores every timestamp (125X more than Token Bucket!)
❌ **Slow** - Must scan all timestamps (O(n) per request)
❌ **Not scalable** - Can't handle millions of requests/sec
❌ **Complex** - Requires sorted data structures

#### Storage Reality
```
Per user with 100 requests in window:

Token Bucket: 1 counter = 8 bytes
Fixed Window: 1 counter = 8 bytes
Leaking Bucket: 1 queue = 8 bytes

Sliding Window Log: 100 timestamps × 20 bytes = 2000 bytes
                   That's 250X MORE!

At 1M requests/sec:
  Token Bucket: 8MB total
  Sliding Window Log: 200MB per SECOND!
  
Cost: $200,000+/month for cloud storage!
```

#### When to Use
- **Only for**: Critical systems where cost is irrelevant
- **Examples**: Payment systems, security audit logs, fraud detection
- **Key requirement**: Perfect accuracy > performance/cost

#### Real-World Case: Payment Systems
```
Some payment processors use Sliding Window Log:
- Financial transactions can't have exploitable edge cases
- Cost of errors: Customer double-charged, fraud, etc.
- Memory and CPU cost is acceptable
- Accuracy is non-negotiable
```

---

### 5️⃣ Sliding Window Counter ⭐ (Recommended)

#### How It Works

```
Concept: Use TWO counters to estimate rolling window (not store all timestamps!)

Store: 
  - Previous window count
  - Current window count
  - Window start timestamp (just 1!)

Calculate:
  requests_in_rolling_window ≈ current_count + (previous_count × overlap%)
  
If estimate < limit: ACCEPT
Else: REJECT
```

#### Problems It Solves

From Token Bucket:
❌ Hard to tune parameters
✅ **Just set window size - math handles the rest!**

From Leaking Bucket:
❌ High latency
✅ **O(1) response time, no queueing!**

From Fixed Window:
❌ Exploitable edge cases
✅ **Uses rolling window concept, impossible to exploit!**

From Sliding Window Log:
❌ Too expensive (memory/CPU)
✅ **Just 24 bytes per user (vs 2000 for Log)!**

#### Using Scenario A (Web API)

```
Configuration: Window = 1 min, Limit = 10, Position = 30% into current

T=0:00:  3 requests arrive
         prev_count = 0
         curr_count = 3
         Status: ✓ Accept all (3 < 10)

T=0:06:  Quiet period (no new requests)
         Window change at 1:00
         Tokens built up mentally

T=0:09:  9 requests arrive (burst!)
         Current window: 3 requests
         Previous window: 0 requests
         Overlap: 51/60 = 85%
         
         Estimate: 3 + (0 × 0.85) = 3
         Status: 3 < 10 ✓ Accept request #1
         curr_count = 4
         
         Estimate: 4 + (0 × 0.85) = 4
         Status: 4 < 10 ✓ Accept request #2
         ... continue ...
         
         Estimate: 10 + (0 × 0.85) = 10
         Status: 10 >= 10 ✗ Reject requests #9, #10

Result: 8/9 accepted (89% success)
Latency: ~0ms (just one calculation!)
Memory: 24 bytes per user (3 small values)
Accuracy: 99.997% (Cloudflare tested on 400M requests)
```

#### Advantages
✅ **Fast** - O(1) calculation
✅ **Memory efficient** - 24 bytes (vs 2000 for Log)
✅ **Accurate** - 99.997% accuracy
✅ **Secure** - No exploitable boundaries
✅ **Balanced** - Perfect combination of speed, cost, accuracy

#### Limitations
❌ Not 100% perfect accuracy (but 0.003% error is acceptable!)
❌ Assumes even distribution of previous window requests
❌ Only works for reasonable window sizes

#### Storage Breakdown
```
Per user:
  Token Bucket:            8 bytes
  Fixed Window:            8 bytes
  Leaking Bucket:          8 bytes
  Sliding Window Counter: 24 bytes (3 values: prev, curr, start_time)
  Sliding Window Log:    2000 bytes
  
Comparison:
  Counter vs Log: 83X more efficient! ✓
  Counter vs others: Only 3X more storage (acceptable!)
```

#### When to Use
- **Best for**: Most production systems (99% of use cases!)
- **Examples**: Twitter, GitHub, Google APIs, Stripe, most SaaS
- **Key requirement**: Good balance of speed, cost, accuracy

#### Real-World Case: Most Companies
```
Why Sliding Window Counter is most popular:

1. SPEED: No scanning, just 1 calculation
2. MEMORY: Minimal cost at scale
3. ACCURACY: Good enough (99.997%)
4. SECURITY: No exploitable edges
5. SIMPLICITY: Easy to understand and tune

Result: Default choice for most production APIs!
```

## Interview Q&A

### Design Questions

**Q1: Design a rate limiter for Twitter**

```
Requirements:
- 10M daily active users
- Burst traffic (tweets spike during news events)
- Different limits for different user tiers
- Need to handle global distribution

Answer approach:
1. Choose Sliding Window Counter (balance of speed/cost/accuracy)
2. Use per-user buckets (multiple limits per user)
3. Store in Redis (distributed, fast)
4. Handle distributed synchronization with Redis
5. Deploy in multiple data centers
6. Use eventual consistency for geo-sync
```

**Q2: Your API is using Fixed Window and attackers are exploiting it**

```
Problem: Requests at window boundaries allow 2X limit

Solutions in order of preference:
1. Switch to Sliding Window Counter (best balance)
2. Switch to Sliding Window Log (if money no object)
3. Randomize window boundaries (hacky, partial fix)
4. Use shorter windows (reduced exploit window)
5. Token Bucket (if burst OK)

Why Sliding Counter best:
- Eliminates edge case exploitation
- Maintains performance
- Minimal cost increase
- Easy to migrate to
```

**Q3: Rate limiter uses 500GB memory for 1M req/sec, how to optimize?**

```
Current: Probably Sliding Window Log (2000 bytes per user)
Need: Reduce from 500GB

Solutions:
1. Switch to Sliding Window Counter (24 bytes per user)
   = 500GB / 2000 * 24 = 6GB (83X reduction!)
   
2. Reduce precision (store 10-sec windows instead of 1-sec)
   
3. Aggregate users into buckets
   
4. Use time-decay (old data less important)
   
Best: Switch algorithm + increase batch aggregation
Result: 6GB storage, same accuracy!
```

**Q4: Handle distributed rate limiting across 3 data centers**

```
Challenges:
1. Race condition: Two servers increment same counter
2. Synchronization: Counter values not in sync

Solutions:
1. Centralized Redis: All servers query same Redis
   - Single source of truth
   - Network latency trade-off

2. Lua scripts: Atomic operations (read-check-write)
   - Prevents race condition in single op
   - Can't be interrupted

3. Eventual consistency: Accept brief inconsistency
   - Each DC has local counters
   - Sync periodically
   - 0.1% occasional overdraft OK

Best approach: Redis + Lua + eventual consistency for sync
```

**Q5: How would you migrate from Token Bucket to Sliding Window Counter?**

```
Strategy:
1. Deploy Sliding Counter alongside existing Token Bucket
   - New code: Use Sliding Counter
   - Old code: Keep Token Bucket
   
2. Canary rollout (10% traffic)
   - Monitor accuracy
   - Verify no issues
   
3. Gradual migration (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
   - Keep both systems in sync initially
   - Fall back easily if needed
   
4. Deprecate Token Bucket
   - Remove after successful migration
   
Timeline: 2-4 weeks for safe migration
Risk: Low (can always fall back)
```

### Problem-Solving Questions

**Q6: API has legitimate users hitting rate limits, how to debug?**

```
Root cause analysis:
1. Is it Fixed Window? Check for edge case exploitation
   - Monitor request timing patterns
   - Look for clusters at :00 seconds

2. Is Token Bucket? Parameters might be wrong
   - Check bucket size vs expected bursts
   - Analyze traffic distribution

3. Is Leaking Bucket? Legitimate users waiting
   - Check average queue time
   - Compare to SLA

Solution depends on algorithm!
For Sliding Counter: User might genuinely exceed limit
→ Adjust limit, not algorithm
```

**Q7: How would you handle different rate limits for different user tiers?**

```
Design:
1. Multiple buckets/counters per user
   Free tier: 10 req/min
   Pro tier: 1000 req/min
   Enterprise: 100,000 req/min

2. Check user tier on each request
   user_tier = fetch_from_cache(user_id)
   bucket = get_bucket(user_id, user_tier)
   check_limit(bucket)

3. Update on tier change
   Need to reset counter or migrate gracefully

Implementation:
- Separate Redis keys per tier
- Cache tier info locally
- Periodic sync of tier changes
```

### Trade-off Questions

**Q8: Why not always use Sliding Window Log for perfect accuracy?**

```
Trade-offs:
✓ Pros: Perfect accuracy (100%)
✗ Cons: 
  - 125X more memory
  - 100X slower (O(n) vs O(1))
  - Complex to implement
  - Doesn't scale to large traffic

When to accept trade-off:
- Money is no object
- Security/compliance requires it
- Traffic is low (<10K req/sec)
- Example: Payment system

Reality:
- 99.9% of systems: Sliding Counter is fine
- 0.1% of systems: Need Window Log
```

**Q9: Token Bucket vs Sliding Window Counter - which to choose?**

```
Token Bucket better when:
✓ Burst traffic is feature, not bug
✓ Want to give users bonus capacity
✓ Real-time responsiveness critical
Example: Video streaming, social media

Sliding Counter better when:
✓ Want steady, predictable behavior
✓ Burst traffic is attack, not feature
✓ Slightly less perfect latency OK
Example: Payment APIs, resource limits

In practice:
- 60% use Sliding Counter (best balance)
- 30% use Token Bucket (burst handling)
- 10% use others (specific requirements)
```

## Implementation Guide

### Choosing Where to Place Rate Limiter

```
1. CLIENT-SIDE: ✗ Don't do this!
   - Unreliable (users can spoof)
   - No security value

2. APPLICATION CODE: ✓ OK for small systems
   - Part of your code
   - Direct access to request
   - Hard to update without redeployment

3. API GATEWAY/MIDDLEWARE: ✓ RECOMMENDED
   - Separate service
   - Works for all backend services
   - Can update independently
   - Example: Kong, AWS API Gateway, Nginx
```

### Storage: Why Redis?

```
Options:
1. Database:     ✗ Too slow (disk access = 10-100ms)
2. Memory cache: ✓ Fast (in-memory = 1µs)
3. Redis:        ✓ Perfect (in-memory + distributed)

Why Redis:
✓ Fast (in-memory operations)
✓ Atomic operations (INCR, EXPIRE)
✓ Distributed (shared across servers)
✓ Expiration support (auto-cleanup of old data)
✓ Sorted sets (for Sliding Window Log)

Commands needed:
- INCR: Increment counter atomically
- EXPIRE: Set auto-expiration time
- DEL: Delete expired counters
- ZINCRBY: For sliding window log
```

### Rate Limit Headers

```
HTTP Response should include:

X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
  → Maximum requests allowed in window

X-RateLimit-Remaining: 37
  → How many requests left in window

X-RateLimit-Reset: 1719072060
  → Unix timestamp when limit resets

X-Retry-After: 45
  → If rate limited: seconds to wait before retry

Client can use these to:
- Know when limit resets
- Implement smart backoff
- Display remaining quota to users
```

### Client Retry Strategy

```
When client gets 429 (Too Many Requests):

1. EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF: Don't retry immediately
   Retry 1: Wait 1 second
   Retry 2: Wait 2 seconds
   Retry 3: Wait 4 seconds
   (Don't hammer the server!)

2. USE X-RETRY-AFTER: Server tells you when to retry
   Wait until X-Retry-After timestamp
   Then retry

3. MAX RETRIES: Don't retry forever
   Give up after 3-5 attempts
   Return error to user

Pseudo-code:
```
retry_count = 0
while retry_count < 3:
    response = make_request()
    if response.status == 429:
        wait_time = response.headers['X-Retry-After']
        sleep(wait_time)
        retry_count += 1
    else:
        return response
return error("Max retries exceeded")
```
```

---

## Distributed Systems Challenges

### Challenge 1: Race Conditions

**Problem:**
```
Two requests arrive simultaneously
Both read counter = 3
Both check: 3 < 10? YES
Both write: counter = 4
Both allowed!

But counter should be 5!
Off by 1 error, multiplied = overflow!
```

**Solution: Lua Scripts**
```
Redis Lua script (atomic):

local current = redis.call('GET', key)
if current < limit then
    redis.call('INCR', key)
    return true
else
    return false
end

Lua runs atomically:
- Read, check, write happen together
- Can't be interrupted
- Perfect for race condition prevention
```

### Challenge 2: Synchronization Across Data Centers

**Problem:**
```
User in US: Requests go to US data center
User in EU: Requests go to EU data center

US DC has counter: 5 requests
EU DC has counter: 3 requests

But both serve same user!
User is rate limited in US, not in EU
Inconsistent!
```

**Solution: Centralized Redis**
```
All data centers → Single Redis instance

Benefits:
✓ Single source of truth
✓ Consistent across DCs

Trade-off:
✗ Network latency (100-200ms for distant DC)
✗ Single point of failure

Mitigation:
- Redis cluster with replication
- Fall back to local counters if central fails
- Sync eventually when connection restored
```

### Challenge 3: Eventual Consistency

**Problem:**
```
Want fast response (local processing)
But want consistent counters (central storage)
Can't have both!
```

**Solution: Accept Brief Inconsistency**
```
Strategy:
1. Each DC has local cache of counters
2. Cache expires every 10 seconds
3. Sync with central Redis periodically
4. Small overdraft OK (0.1% of requests)

Example:
- User sent 9 requests to US DC
- Cache expires
- User sends 2 more requests in EU DC
- EU: Doesn't know about 9 from US
- Both get through (11 total, limit was 10)
- Eventually consistent: Counter syncs after 10s

Acceptable because:
- 0.1% error rate is OK for most systems
- Performance gain worth it
- Real-time systems can't wait for sync
```

## Edge Cases & Gotchas

### Edge Case 1: Clock Skew

**Problem:**
```
Server A time: 12:00:00
Server B time: 11:59:50 (5 seconds behind)

Window reset happens at different times!
A: Window ends at 12:00:00
B: Window ends at 11:59:50

Possible overflow!
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Use NTP (Network Time Protocol)
   - Keep all servers synchronized
   - Usually within 1ms

2. Use server timestamp in requests
   - Accept timestamp from central server
   - Not from local clock

3. Build in time buffer
   - Accept 5-second skew
   - Conservative limits
```

### Edge Case 2: Sudden Traffic Spike

**Problem:**
```
Normal traffic: 100 req/sec
Sudden spike: 50,000 req/sec (flash sale!)

Rate limiter can't keep up!
Legitimate requests rejected!
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Over-provision capacity
   - Limit should be 2X expected peak
   
2. Use Token Bucket
   - Allows burst during spike
   
3. Implement circuit breaker
   - Temporary override during crisis
   - Manual approval for critical traffic
   
4. Alert monitoring
   - Detect spikes early
   - Scale up before hitting limit
```

### Edge Case 3: User Identity Issues

**Problem:**
```
Rate limiter key: IP address
User: Shared IP (corporate proxy)
Result: All employees share same limit!

Rate limiter key: User ID
User: Not logged in yet
Result: Can't identify during auth
```

**Solution:**
```
Use multiple keys:
1. IP address: First line of defense
2. User ID (if logged in): Per-user limit
3. Session ID: Prevent anonymous abuse

Combine intelligently:
- Anonymous: IP-based only
- Logged in: User ID based
- Admin: No limit (whitelisted)
```

## Real-World Companies & Their Approaches

| Company | Algorithm | Details | Scale |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Twitter** | Token Bucket (now Sliding Counter) | 300 tweets per 3 hours, burst-friendly | 10M DAU |
| **GitHub** | Sliding Window Counter | 60 req/hr (public), 5000 (auth) | Enterprise |
| **Google** | Token Bucket | Varies by API, generous burst | Global |
| **Stripe** | Token Bucket | Customizable per endpoint | Enterprise |
| **Shopify** | Leaking Bucket | Steady order processing | Millions |
| **AWS** | Sliding Window Counter | Per-service customization | Largest |
| **CloudFlare** | Sliding Window Counter | DDoS protection, multi-layer | Billions req/day |

## Summary: Quick Reference

```
SIMPLE QUESTION: "Which algorithm should I use?"

SIMPLE ANSWER:
1. Use Sliding Window Counter ⭐ (default, 99% of cases)
2. Use Token Bucket if burst traffic is desired feature
3. Use Leaking Bucket if background processing
4. Use Fixed Window only for non-critical quotas
5. Use Sliding Window Log only if money is no object

ARCHITECTURE:
- Place in API Gateway/Middleware
- Store in Redis (distributed)
- Use Lua scripts for atomicity
- Implement monitoring and alerts
- Sync across DCs eventually

CLIENT SIDE:
- Respect X-RateLimit headers
- Implement exponential backoff
- Use X-Retry-After for retry timing
- Cache locally when possible
```
