## Problem Statement

A **rate limiter** is used to control the rate of traffic sent by a client or service. In the HTTP world, it limits the number of client requests allowed to be sent over a specified period. If the API request count exceeds the threshold defined by the rate limiter, all excess calls are blocked.

### Real-World Examples:
- A user can write no more than 2 posts per second
- You can create a maximum of 10 accounts per day from the same IP address
- You can claim rewards no more than 5 times per week from the same device

### Real-World Rate Limits:
- **Twitter**: 300 tweets per 3 hours
- **Google Docs APIs**: 300 per user per 60 seconds for read requests

---

## Benefits of Rate Limiting

### 1. **Prevent DoS Attacks**
- Almost all APIs published by large tech companies enforce some form of rate limiting
- Prevents both intentional and unintentional Denial of Service attacks
- Protects resources from being starved by malicious users

### 2. **Reduce Costs**
- Limiting excess requests means fewer servers and resources allocated
- Extremely important for companies using paid third-party APIs
- External APIs (check credit, make payment, retrieve health records, etc.) are charged on a per-call basis

### 3. **Prevent Server Overload**
- Filters out excess requests caused by bots or users' misbehavior
- Reduces server load during traffic spikes
- Ensures stable performance for legitimate users

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
- **Accurately limit excessive requests** - Must prevent requests exceeding the threshold
- **Flexible throttling** - Support different throttle rules (IP, user ID, or other properties)
- **Distributed** - Work across multiple servers/processes
- **Clear feedback** - Inform users when they are throttled (HTTP 429 status code)

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Low latency** - Rate limiter should not slow down HTTP response time
- **Memory efficient** - Use minimal memory
- **High fault tolerance** - If a component fails, it doesn't affect the entire system
- **Large scale** - Support high number of requests in a distributed environment

---

## Different Solutions/Algorithms

### 1. Token Bucket Algorithm ⭐ (Most Popular)

**How It Works:**
- A token bucket has pre-defined capacity
- Tokens are added to the bucket at preset rates periodically
- Each request consumes one token
- If there are enough tokens, request goes through; otherwise, it's dropped

**Example:**
```
Bucket Capacity: 4 tokens
Refill Rate: 2 tokens per second

Request arrives:
- Check if tokens available
- If yes: consume 1 token, allow request
- If no: drop request
```

**Parameters:**
- **Bucket size**: Maximum number of tokens allowed in the bucket
- **Refill rate**: Number of tokens added per second

**How Many Buckets?**
- Different bucket per API endpoint (e.g., 1 post/sec, 150 friends/day, 5 likes/sec → 3 buckets per user)
- Different bucket per IP address
- Global bucket for entire system

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy to implement
- ✅ Memory efficient
- ✅ Allows burst traffic for short periods
- ✅ Used by Amazon and Stripe

**Cons:**
- ❌ Challenging to tune bucket size and refill rate properly
- ❌ Two parameters to optimize

#### **Detailed Example: Handling Burst Traffic**

**Configuration:**
```
Bucket Capacity: 10 tokens
Refill Rate: 1 token per second
Scenario: [3 requests] → 6 seconds quiet → [9 requests burst]
```

**Phase 1: Initial Requests (T=0s)**
```
Bucket state: 10/10 tokens (full)

3 requests arrive at T=0s:
  Request #1: Takes 1 token (9 remain) ✓
  Request #2: Takes 1 token (8 remain) ✓
  Request #3: Takes 1 token (7 remain) ✓

Result: 100% success (3/3 accepted)
After: 7 tokens remain
```

**Phase 2: Quiet Period (T=0s to T=9s) - THE GENIUS PART!**
```
No new requests, but tokens keep refilling:

T=1s:  Tokens: 7 → 8   (+1 per second)
T=2s:  Tokens: 8 → 9
T=3s:  Tokens: 9 → 10 (FULL! Capacity reached)
T=4-9s: Tokens: 10 → 10 (cannot exceed capacity)

KEY INSIGHT: During quiet period, tokens ACCUMULATE
This builds a RESERVE for upcoming burst!
```

**Phase 3: BURST Handling (T=9s)**
```
9 requests arrive suddenly!

Bucket state: 10/10 tokens (fully charged from quiet period)

Processing:
  Request #1: Takes 1 token (9 remain) ✓
  Request #2: Takes 1 token (8 remain) ✓
  Request #3: Takes 1 token (7 remain) ✓
  Request #4: Takes 1 token (6 remain) ✓
  Request #5: Takes 1 token (5 remain) ✓
  Request #6: Takes 1 token (4 remain) ✓
  Request #7: Takes 1 token (3 remain) ✓
  Request #8: Takes 1 token (2 remain) ✓
  Request #9: NO TOKEN! ✗ REJECTED

Result: 8/9 accepted (89% success rate!)
After: 2 tokens remain
```

#### **Why Token Bucket Excels at Bursts:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  The Token Bucket Strategy:          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. During quiet times → Save tokens  │
│ 2. During busy times → Spend tokens  │
│                                      │
│ Like a SAVINGS ACCOUNT:              │
│ - Deposit during good times          │
│ - Withdraw during emergency          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Advantages:**
- ✅ **Burst Absorption** - Can handle 10 requests at once if capacity=10
- ✅ **Low Latency** - Responses near-instant (not queued)
- ✅ **Rewards Fast Users** - No waiting in queue
- ✅ **Reserve Building** - Accumulates during quiet periods
- ✅ **Natural Traffic Fit** - Web traffic IS naturally bursty!

**Companies Using Token Bucket:**
- Amazon (AWS API Gateway)
- Google (Google APIs, Docs)
- Stripe (Payment APIs)
- GitHub (GitHub API)

### 2. Leaking Bucket Algorithm

#### **Core Concept**

Leaking Bucket is like a **water tank with a small hole at the bottom**:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Incoming Water  │ ← Water flowing in (requests arriving)
│ (requests)      │
├─────────────────┤
│                 │
│   QUEUE OF      │ ← Water stored in tank (requests waiting)
│   REQUESTS      │
│                 │
├─────────────────┤
│        ~        │ ← Small hole at bottom (leak)
└─────────────────┘
        ↓
   PROCESSED      ← Water flowing out at FIXED RATE
   REQUESTS         (constant, predictable)
```

**Key Characteristic:** Requests leak out at a **constant, predictable rate**, no matter how many requests flow in!

#### **How It Works:**

1. When a request arrives, the system checks if the queue is full
2. If queue is NOT full, the request is added to queue (FIFO order)
3. If queue IS full, the request is **dropped/rejected**
4. A background process removes requests from the queue at a **fixed rate**
5. Requests are processed in order (First-In-First-Out)

#### **Parameters:**

1. **Queue Size (Bucket Capacity)** - How many requests can wait?
   - Example: Maximum 10 requests in queue

2. **Outflow Rate (Leak Rate)** - How fast are requests processed?
   - Example: 1 request per 6 seconds (or 10 requests per minute)

3. **FIFO (First In, First Out)** - Processing order
   - First request added to queue is processed first
   - Fair to all requests

#### **Real-World Usage:**
- **Shopify** uses this for rate-limiting
- Email systems, job queues, database protection

#### **Phase-by-Phase Example**

**Configuration:**
```
Queue Capacity: 10 requests
Outflow Rate: 1 request per 6 seconds
Scenario: [3 requests] → 6 seconds quiet → [9 requests arrive]
```

**Phase 1: Initial Requests (T=0s)**
```
3 requests arrive at T=0s

Queue state: Empty (0/10)

Action:
  Request #1 enters → Queue: [R1]          (1/10) ✓
  Request #2 enters → Queue: [R1, R2]      (2/10) ✓
  Request #3 enters → Queue: [R1, R2, R3]  (3/10) ✓

Result: All 3 ACCEPTED and added to queue
Status: PROCESSING at fixed rate

Timeline:
  T=0s:  R1 at front, will exit at T=6s
  T=6s:  R1 exits ✓, R2 moves to front, will exit at T=12s
  T=12s: R2 exits ✓, R3 moves to front, will exit at T=18s
  T=18s: R3 exits ✓
```

**Phase 2: Quiet Period (T=0s to T=9s)**
```
No new requests, but processing continues at FIXED RATE

T=0s:  Queue: [R1, R2, R3]  (3 items, processing)
T=3s:  Queue: [R1, R2, R3]  (processing R1, will exit at T=6s)
T=6s:  Queue: [R2, R3]      (R1 exits! ✓ Done)
T=9s:  Queue: [R2, R3]      (R2 still processing, will exit at T=12s)

Key insight: Queue DRAINS steadily to 2 items
No "accumulation" like Token Bucket - constant leak!
```

**Phase 3: THE BURST (T=9s)**
```
9 requests arrive suddenly!

Queue state BEFORE: [R2, R3]  (2 items, can hold 10 max)

Processing incoming burst:
  R4 arrives  → Queue: [R2, R3, R4]        (3/10) ✓
  R5 arrives  → Queue: [R2, R3, R4, R5]    (4/10) ✓
  R6 arrives  → Queue: [..., R4, R5, R6]   (5/10) ✓
  R7 arrives  → Queue: [..., R5, R6, R7]   (6/10) ✓
  R8 arrives  → Queue: [..., R6, R7, R8]   (7/10) ✓
  R9 arrives  → Queue: [..., R7, R8, R9]   (8/10) ✓
  R10 arrives → Queue: [..., R8, R9, R10]  (9/10) ✓
  R11 arrives → Queue: [..., R9, R10, R11] (10/10) ✓ FULL!
  R12 arrives → ✗ REJECTED (queue full)

Result: 8 requests ACCEPTED
        1 request REJECTED (dropped)
```

**The Critical Difference: Wait Times!**

```
Token Bucket: R4 processed FAST (near-instant)

Leaking Bucket: R4 has to WAIT!
  R2: Exits at T=12s (wait: 3 seconds remaining)
  R3: Exits at T=18s (wait: 9 seconds from arrival at T=9s)
  R4: Exits at T=24s (wait: 15 seconds!)
  R5: Exits at T=30s (wait: 21 seconds!)
  ...
  R11: Exits at T=66s (wait: 57 seconds!) 😱
  R12: DROPPED immediately (no wait, just rejected)
```

#### **Comparison: Token Bucket vs Leaking Bucket**

| Scenario | Token Bucket | Leaking Bucket |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **3 initial requests** | Accepted immediately, fast response | Accepted, but wait in queue |
| **Quiet 6 seconds** | Tokens accumulate (recover capacity) | Queue drains at fixed rate |
| **9 requests at T=9s** | 8 accepted immediately (low latency) | 8 queued (high latency), 1 dropped |
| **Last request wait** | Near-instant | 57 seconds! |
| **User experience** | Fast, responsive | Slow, but predictable |

#### **Wait Time Formula**

```
For a request at position N in queue:
  wait_time = (N × time_per_request)
  
Example with 1 req/6sec:
  Position 1: Wait = 1 × 6 = 6 seconds
  Position 5: Wait = 5 × 6 = 30 seconds
  Position 10: Wait = 10 × 6 = 60 seconds
```

#### **Pros:**
- ✅ **Predictable output rate** - Always processes at fixed speed
- ✅ **Fair processing** - FIFO order (first request gets processed first)
- ✅ **Memory efficient** - Limited queue size
- ✅ **Protects backend** - Steady load on DB/workers
- ✅ **No token tuning** - Just set queue size and processing rate

**Cons:**
- ❌ **High latency** - Requests wait in queue (not ideal for APIs)
- ❌ **Burst handling poor** - Recent requests queued behind old ones
- ❌ **Not suitable for user-facing APIs** - Users hate waiting
- ❌ **Queue fills during bursts** - Excess requests dropped

#### **When to Use Leaking Bucket:**

✅ **Job Queue Processing**
```
Example: Background task processor
  - Limit: 10 tasks queued at a time
  - Rate: Process 1 task per second
  - Use: Protects database from overload
```

✅ **Email Sending System**
```
Example: Send marketing emails
  - Limit: Queue 1000 emails
  - Rate: Send 100 emails per minute
  - Use: Email server can handle steady load
```

✅ **Database Write Protection**
```
Example: Protect database from write spikes
  - Limit: 50 write operations in queue
  - Rate: 5 writes per second
  - Use: DB can process writes steadily
```

✅ **Resource-Constrained Systems**
```
Example: Limited worker pool, print queue, video encoding
  - When backend has limited processing capacity
  - Need predictable, steady output
  - Can tolerate wait times
```

#### **When NOT to Use Leaking Bucket:**

❌ **Public REST APIs**
- Users expect instant responses
- High latency is unacceptable

❌ **Real-time Systems**
- Need low latency responses
- Can't queue requests

❌ **Bursty Traffic**
- Natural traffic spikes (peak hours)
- Users will experience long waits

---

#### **Deep Comparison: Token Bucket vs Leaking Bucket**

**Same Scenario Applied to Both:**
```
Limit: 60 requests per minute (1 per second or 10 per 10 seconds)
Traffic: [3 requests at T=0s] → quiet 6 seconds → [9 requests at T=9s]
```

**TOKEN BUCKET TIMELINE:**
```
T=0s:   3 requests arrive
        Bucket: 10/10 tokens
        ✓ Accept 3, take 3 tokens
        Bucket now: 7/10

T=1-3s: Quiet, tokens refill
        +1 token per second
        Bucket: 8/10 → 9/10 → 10/10 (full!)

T=4-8s: Quiet continues
        Bucket: 10/10 (capped, cannot exceed)
        
T=9s:   9 requests arrive
        Bucket: 10/10 tokens ready!
        ✓ Accept 8, take 8 tokens
        ✗ Reject 1 (no tokens)
        Bucket now: 2/10

Result: 8/9 requests processed IMMEDIATELY
        Latency: ~0ms (instant)
        Success rate: 89%
        User experience: Fast, responsive!
```

**LEAKING BUCKET TIMELINE:**
```
T=0s:   3 requests arrive
        Queue: [R1, R2, R3] (3/10)
        ✓ Accept all 3
        Outflow begins: 1 request every 6 seconds

T=6s:   R1 processed and exits
        R2 at front of queue, will exit at T=12s
        Queue: [R2, R3] (2/10)

T=9s:   9 new requests arrive
        Queue before: [R2, R3] (2/10)
        Queue after burst:
          ✓ R4-R11 added (8 requests fit)
          ✗ R12 rejected (queue full at 10)
        Queue: [R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11]
        (all 10 slots filled)

T=12s:  R2 processed and exits
        Queue: [R3, R4, ..., R11] (9 items)
        Next exit at T=18s

T=18s:  R3 exits
        Queue: [R4, R5, ..., R11] (8 items)
        
...continuing at 1 per 6 seconds...

T=24s:  R4 exits (waited 15 seconds after arriving at T=9s!)
T=30s:  R5 exits (waited 21 seconds!)
T=36s:  R6 exits (waited 27 seconds!)
...
T=66s:  R11 exits (waited 57 SECONDS!)

Result: 8/9 requests processed, but with LONG WAITS
        Latency: R4 = 15s, R5 = 21s, R11 = 57s!
        Success rate: 89% (same as Token Bucket)
        User experience: Slow, frustrating!
```

**Head-to-Head Comparison:**

| Metric | Token Bucket | Leaking Bucket |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Requests Accepted** | 8/9 (89%) | 8/9 (89%) |
| **Requests Rejected** | 1 | 1 |
| **Processing Speed** | FAST (instant) | SLOW (queue delays) |
| **Latency** | ~0-10ms | 15-57 seconds |
| **User Experience** | Excellent | Poor |
| **Burst Handling** | Great | Terrible |
| **Predictability** | Variable | Constant |
| **Best Use Case** | Web APIs | Job queues |

├─ When party arrives, they sit immediately (tokens ready)
├─ Everyone gets good service without waiting
└─ Handles dinner rush gracefully

LEAKING BUCKET = Bank Teller Queue
├─ Customers join a line (queue up)
├─ Teller serves one customer at fixed rate (1 every 6 minutes)
├─ Last customer might wait hours
└─ Steady, predictable processing but terrible customer experience
```

### 3. Fixed Window Counter Algorithm

#### **Core Concept**

Fixed Window Counter divides time into **fixed-size buckets** and counts requests in each bucket:

```
Timeline:
┌──────────────┐──────────────┐──────────────┐
│ Window 1     │ Window 2     │ Window 3     │
│ 0:00 - 0:10  │ 0:10 - 0:20  │ 0:20 - 0:30  │
│ Counter: 0   │ Counter: 0   │ Counter: 0   │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**How It Works:**
1. Divide timeline into equal-sized windows (e.g., 10 seconds each)
2. Each window has a counter starting at 0
3. Each request increments the counter by 1
4. If counter < limit, request accepted
5. If counter ≥ limit, request rejected
6. When window ends, counter RESETS to 0 for next window

#### **Parameters:**

1. **Window Size** - Time duration of each window
   - Example: 10 seconds

2. **Request Limit** - Max requests allowed per window
   - Example: 10 requests per 10 seconds

#### **Simple Example: Using Scenario**

**Configuration:**
```
Window Size: 10 seconds
Request Limit: 10 requests per window
Scenario: [3 requests at T=0s] → 6 sec quiet → [9 requests at T=9s]
```

**Phase 1: Initial Requests (T=0s)**
```
Current window: [T=0s to T=10s]
Counter: 0

3 requests arrive at T=0s:
  Request #1: Counter: 0 → 1 ✓ (1 ≤ 10)
  Request #2: Counter: 1 → 2 ✓ (2 ≤ 10)
  Request #3: Counter: 2 → 3 ✓ (3 ≤ 10)

Result: All 3 ACCEPTED
Current counter: 3/10
Remaining quota: 7 requests
```

**Phase 2: Quiet Period (T=0s to T=9s)**
```
Same window [T=0s to T=10s] still active
Counter: 3 (no change during quiet)

T=0-9s: No new requests arrive
        Counter stays at 3
        Still 7 requests quota remaining
        
T=10s: Window ends! Counter RESETS to 0
       New window [T=10s to T=20s] begins
```

**Phase 3: BURST (T=9s) - Initial Look (seems OK)**
```
Current window: [T=0s to T=10s] (still 1 second left!)
Counter: 3/10

9 requests arrive at T=9s:
  Request #1: Counter: 3 → 4  ✓ (4 ≤ 10)
  Request #2: Counter: 4 → 5  ✓ (5 ≤ 10)
  Request #3: Counter: 5 → 6  ✓ (6 ≤ 10)
  Request #4: Counter: 6 → 7  ✓ (7 ≤ 10)
  Request #5: Counter: 7 → 8  ✓ (8 ≤ 10)
  Request #6: Counter: 8 → 9  ✓ (9 ≤ 10)
  Request #7: Counter: 9 → 10 ✓ (10 ≤ 10, at limit!)
  Request #8: Counter: 10 (LIMIT REACHED) ✗ REJECTED
  Request #9: Counter: 10 (LIMIT REACHED) ✗ REJECTED

Result: 7/9 requests accepted
        2/9 requests rejected
Counter: 10/10 (FULL)
```

#### **⚠️ THE CRITICAL PROBLEM: Edge Case Burst**

This algorithm has a **FATAL FLAW** at window boundaries! Let me show you:

**Evil Scenario (showing the problem):**
```
Window Size: 1 minute
Request Limit: 5 requests per minute

Window 1: [2:00:00 - 2:01:00]     Window 2: [2:01:00 - 2:02:00]
```

**Timeline showing WHERE IT BREAKS:**
```
Window 1: [2:00:00 - 2:01:00]
  Counter: 0/5
  T=2:00:55: 5 requests arrive ✓
  Counter: 0 → 5 (FULL at last 5 seconds of window)

Window boundary (RESET!)

Window 2: [2:01:00 - 2:02:00]
  Counter: 0/5 ← RESET!
  T=2:01:05: 5 requests arrive ✓
  Counter: 0 → 5 (FULL at first 5 seconds of new window)

THE PROBLEM:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
In the ROLLING 10-second window [2:00:55 - 2:01:05]:
  • 5 requests processed at 2:00:55
  • 5 requests processed at 2:01:05
  • TOTAL: 10 requests in 10 seconds!
  
But the LIMIT is 5 per MINUTE!
  • Expected: 5 requests max per minute
  • Actual: 10 requests allowed in 10 seconds! 🚨
  
That's 2X the allowed rate! CRITICAL FAILURE!
```

**Visual Breakdown:**
```
Limit: 5 requests/minute (60 seconds)

Minute 1: [12:00:00 - 12:01:00]
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                            │
│ T=12:00:55: 5 reqs ✓ (last 5 sec)         │
│ Counter: 0 → 5/5 FULL                      │
│                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓ WINDOW ENDS, COUNTER RESETS!

Minute 2: [12:01:00 - 12:02:00]

│ T=12:01:05: 5 reqs ✓ (first 5 sec)        │
│ Counter: 0 → 5/5 FULL (FRESH WINDOW!)      │

ROLLING WINDOW [12:00:55 - 12:01:05]:
┌─────────────┐─────────────┐
│Minute 1: 5  │Minute 2: 5  │ = 10 requests in 10 seconds!
│ Last 5 sec  │First 5 sec  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘

EXPECTED: 5 requests max
ACTUAL:   10 requests allowed 🚨 TWICE THE LIMIT!
```

**The Root Cause:**
```
Fixed Window doesn't look at ROLLING TIME.
It looks at ABSOLUTE WINDOWS.

So at the edge where:
  - End of Window 1 quota: Still has unused quota
  - Start of Window 2 quota: Fresh, full quota

Requests can use quota from BOTH windows in a short time!
```

#### **Mathematical Worst Case**

```
For any Fixed Window implementation:
─────────────────────────────────────

If Limit = L requests per time period T:
  Maximum allowed in rolling window = 2L

How?
  Last portion of Window 1: Up to L requests
  First portion of Window 2: Up to L requests
  Combined: Up to 2L requests in < T seconds!

Example:
  Limit: 100 requests per 60 seconds
  Worst case: 200 requests in 60 seconds (at edge)
  Violation: 2X the limit!
```

#### **Complete Timeline Comparison**

**All three algorithms on same scenario:**

```
Scenario: [3 requests at T=0s] → quiet 6s → [9 requests at T=9s]
Limit: 10 requests per 10-second window

TOKEN BUCKET (Bucket: 10, Refill: 1/sec):
  T=0s:  3 requests ✓ (7 tokens remain)
  T=1-3s: Tokens refill (7 → 10)
  T=9s:  9 requests → 8 accepted ✓, 1 dropped ✗
  Result: 8/9 (89% success)
  Latency: ~0ms
  
LEAKING BUCKET (Queue: 10, Rate: 1/6s):
  T=0s:  3 requests queued ✓
  T=9s:  9 requests → 8 queued ✓, 1 dropped ✗
  T=6-66s: Steady processing
  Result: 8/9 (89% success)
  Latency: 15-57 seconds
  
FIXED WINDOW (Window: 10s, Limit: 10):
  T=0s:  3 requests ✓ (counter: 3/10)
  T=9s:  9 requests → 7 accepted ✓, 2 dropped ✗
  Result: 7/9 (78% success)
  Latency: ~0ms
  Risk: Could allow 2X limit at window edge! 🚨
```

#### **Pros:**
- ✅ **Very simple** - Easy to implement
- ✅ **Memory efficient** - Only need 1 counter per window
- ✅ **Fast** - O(1) operation per request
- ✅ **Easy to understand** - Straightforward logic
- ✅ **Good for some use cases** - Works for non-critical limits

**Cons:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL FLAW** - Edge case allows 2X requests at window boundaries
- ❌ **Not strict** - Real rate limiting not properly enforced
- ❌ **Unpredictable spikes** - Burst at edges can overwhelm system
- ❌ **Not suitable for strict limits** - Users can game the system
- ❌ **Hard to tune** - Window size affects vulnerability to edge cases

#### **When to Use Fixed Window:**

✅ **Simple quota systems** - Where edge cases don't matter much
```
Example: Website showing "You viewed 100 articles today"
(Not critical if 200 go through at midnight)
```

✅ **Informational limits** - Not strict enforcement
```
Example: "Free users get 1000 API calls/month"
(Best-effort, not guaranteed)
```

✅ **Best effort** - When approximate limiting is OK
```
Example: "We recommend not more than 100 requests/sec"
(Guideline, not enforced)
```

❌ **NEVER for:**
- Critical rate limiting (payment systems)
- Security-related limits (login attempts)
- Resource protection (database protection)
- Any strict enforcement needed

#### **Real Example: The Vulnerability**

```
GitHub API with Fixed Window (hypothetical):

Limit: 60 requests per hour

Your honest usage:
  59 requests at T=59:50 (last 10 seconds of hour)
  1 more request at T=1:10 (first 10 seconds of next hour)
  
GitHub allows this ✓ (both within their window)

But in reality:
  You made 60 requests in just 20 seconds!
  That's 3600 per hour (vs 60 limit) 🚨

GitHub's Fixed Window said: "OK!" ✗
Real rate limiter would say: "NO!" ✓
```

### 4. Sliding Window Log Algorithm

**How It Works:**
- Keeps track of request timestamps (usually in Redis sorted sets)
- When new request arrives, removes outdated timestamps (older than current window start)
- Adds new request timestamp to log
- If log size ≤ allowed count, request accepted; otherwise rejected

**Example:**
```
Rate limit: 2 requests per minute

1:00:01 - Request arrives, log empty → ACCEPT (log size = 1)
1:00:30 - Request arrives → ACCEPT (log size = 2)
1:00:50 - Request arrives → REJECT (log size = 3, exceeds limit of 2)
1:01:40 - Request arrives
  - Remove outdated timestamps before 1:00:40 (1:00:01, 1:00:30)
  - Add new timestamp → ACCEPT (log size = 2)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very accurate in any rolling window
- ✅ Requests never exceed rate limit

**Cons:**
- ❌ **High memory consumption** - Stores every rejected request timestamp
- ❌ Not scalable for high-traffic systems

---

### 5. Sliding Window Counter Algorithm (Hybrid Approach)

**How It Works:**
- Combines fixed window counter and sliding window log
- Uses formula to estimate requests in rolling window:
  ```
  Requests in current window + 
  (Requests in previous window × overlap percentage of rolling window)
  ```

**Example:**
```
Rate limit: 7 requests per minute
Previous minute requests: 5
Current minute requests: 3
New request arrives at 30% position in current minute:

Calculation: 3 + (5 × 0.7) = 3 + 3.5 = 6.5 → round down to 6
Since 6 < 7 limit: REQUEST ACCEPTED
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Smooths out traffic spikes
- ✅ Based on average rate of previous window
- ✅ Memory efficient

**Cons:**
- ❌ Only works for not-so-strict lookback windows
- ❌ Approximation (assumes even distribution)
- ❌ Cloudflare found only 0.003% error rate among 400M requests (acceptable)

## Architecture Considerations

### Where to Place the Rate Limiter?

#### 1. **Client-Side Implementation** ❌
- **Not recommended** - Clients are unreliable
- Client requests can be forged by malicious actors
- No control over client implementation

#### 2. **Server-Side Implementation** ✅
- Rate limiter placed directly on server
- Added latency to requests
- Coupled with application code

#### 3. **API Gateway/Middleware** ✅ (Recommended)
- Rate limiter as separate middleware
- Decoupled from application
- Supports multiple algorithms
- Popular in microservices architecture

### Storage for Counters

**Why Not Database?**
- ❌ Too slow - disk access latency
- ❌ Not suitable for real-time counters

**Why Redis?** ✅
- ✅ In-memory - fast access
- ✅ Supports time-based expiration
- ✅ Two key commands:
  - `INCR`: Increment counter by 1
  - `EXPIRE`: Set timeout for counter (auto-delete)

### High-Level Architecture Flow

```
1. Client sends request to rate limiter middleware
2. Rate limiter fetches counter from Redis
3. Check if limit reached
   - If YES: Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
   - If NO: Forward to API servers, increment counter, save to Redis
4. Return response with rate limit headers to client
```

---

## Challenges in Distributed Systems

### 1. Race Condition Problem

**Scenario:**
```
Redis counter value: 3
Two concurrent requests read counter simultaneously

Thread 1: Read 3 → Check (3+1 ≤ limit) → Write 4
Thread 2: Read 3 → Check (3+1 ≤ limit) → Write 4

Result: Counter is 4 (WRONG! Should be 5)
```

**Solutions:**
- **Lua Script** - Atomic operation in Redis
- **Sorted Sets** - Redis data structure for atomic operations
- Avoid using simple locks (too slow)

### 2. Synchronization Issue in Multi-Server Setup

**Problem:**
```
Client 1 → Rate Limiter Server 1 (has client 1's counter)
Client 2 → Rate Limiter Server 2 (has client 2's counter)

Due to stateless design, clients might switch servers:
Client 1 → Rate Limiter Server 2 (doesn't have client 1's data!)
Rate limiter doesn't work properly
```

**Solution:**
- Use **centralized data store** (Redis)
- All rate limiter servers fetch/update counters from same Redis
- ❌ Avoid sticky sessions (not scalable, not flexible)

---

## Additional Considerations

### 1. Rate Limiter Response Headers

Inform clients about their rate limit status:

```
X-Ratelimit-Limit: The max requests allowed per time window
X-Ratelimit-Remaining: Remaining requests in current window
X-Ratelimit-Retry-After: When to retry after being rate limited
```

### 2. Handling Rate-Limited Requests

**Option A: Drop Request**
- Return HTTP 429 immediately
- Client must retry

**Option B: Queue for Later**
- Example: Keep orders in queue to process later
- Prevents loss during overload

### 3. Performance Optimization

#### Multi-Data Center Setup
- Deploy rate limiters in geographically distributed edge servers
- Route traffic to closest edge server
- Reduces latency for global users
- Example: Cloudflare has 194+ edge servers worldwide

#### Eventual Consistency
- Synchronize data across data centers with eventual consistency model
- Trade absolute consistency for performance
- Acceptable for rate limiting use cases

### 4. Monitoring & Analytics

**Track:**
- Is the rate limiting algorithm effective?
- Are the rate limiting rules effective?

**Scenarios:**
- Rules too strict → Many valid requests dropped → Relax rules
- Algorithm ineffective during flash sales → Use Token Bucket for burst traffic

### 5. Hard vs Soft Rate Limiting

- **Hard**: Request count cannot exceed threshold (strict)
- **Soft**: Requests can exceed threshold for short period (flexible)

### 6. Rate Limiting at Different OSI Layers

Not just application level (HTTP):
- **Layer 7 (Application)**: HTTP rate limiting (this chapter)
- **Layer 3 (Network)**: IP address rate limiting using Iptables

### 7. Client Best Practices to Avoid Rate Limiting

- Use client-side cache to avoid frequent API calls
- Understand the limit and don't send too many requests in short time
- Implement exception handling for graceful recovery
- Add sufficient backoff time to retry logic
