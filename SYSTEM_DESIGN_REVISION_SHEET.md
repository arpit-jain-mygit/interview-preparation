## BASE ASSUMPTIONS FOR POPULAR SYSTEMS

**How to derive QPS, Storage, and Costs from base metrics:**

| System | DAU | Req/Day | Resp Size | Read:Write | Peak×hrs | Retention | Redundancy | Compression | **QPS: (DAU×Req/Day)÷100K × Peak_mult** | **Storage: DAU×data/user×retention×redundancy÷compression** |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Twitter** | 300M | 20 | 2 KB | 10:1 | 4×4h | 5 yrs | 2x | 1.5x | 60K avg → 240K peak | (3PB × 1,825 × 2) ÷ 1.5 = **7.3 EB** |
| **YouTube** | 500M | 50 | 20 KB | 100:1 | 5×4h | 2 yrs | 3x | 1.1x | 250K avg → 1.25M peak | (50PB × 730 × 3) ÷ 1.1 = **99.5 EB** |
| **Uber** | 100M | 100 | 5 KB | 5:1 | 3×4h | 3mo | 2x | 1.3x | 100K avg → 300K peak | (5TB × 90 × 2) ÷ 1.3 = **0.7 PB** |
| **Netflix** | 300M | 30 | 50 KB | 100:1 | 5×6h | 2 yrs | 3x | 1.1x | 90K avg → 450K peak | (15PB × 730 × 3) ÷ 1.1 = **29.8 EB** |
| **Instagram** | 500M | 100 | 10 KB | 20:1 | 4×4h | 10 yrs | 3x | 1.05x | 500K avg → 2M peak | (5PB × 3,650 × 3) ÷ 1.05 = **52.1 EB** |
| **Stripe** | 1M* | 1000 | 2 KB | 2:1 | 2×8h | 10 yrs | 3x | 1.5x | 100K avg → 200K peak | (10TB × 3,650 × 3) ÷ 1.5 = **0.73 EB** |

**Key Notes:**
- *Stripe DAU = business accounts (not end users)
- Req/Day = requests per user per day (heavy usage systems have higher numbers)
- Resp Size = average response size in bytes
- Read:Write = ratio (more reads = more scalable, fewer writes = smaller DB)
- Peak = multiplier × hours of peak (e.g., 4×4h = 4X traffic for 4 hours)
- Retention = how long data kept (longer = bigger storage costs)
- Redundancy = 2x (master-slave) for standard systems, 3x for critical systems requiring multi-region HA
- Compression = ratio of original size ÷ compressed size (1.5x = reduces by 33%, 1.1x = reduces by 9%)
  - Text (Twitter, Stripe): 1.5x (gzip good for JSON/text)
  - Video (YouTube, Netflix): 1.05-1.1x (already compressed with H.264/VP9)
  - Photos (Instagram): 1.05x (JPEG/WebP already optimized)
  - Location data (Uber): 1.3x (structured, compresses well)
- **Storage column = TOTAL storage for entire retention period** (not per day!)
  - Twitter: 7.3 EB = 5 years of 3PB/day with 2x redundancy & compression
  - YouTube: 99.5 EB = 2 years of 50PB/day with 3x redundancy & compression

**Derived Formulas:**
- **Peak QPS** = (DAU × Req/Day) ÷ 100K × Peak_mult
- **Daily Requests** = (Average_QPS × 3.6K × avg_hrs) + (Peak_QPS × 3.6K × peak_hrs)
- **Daily Data** = DAU × Data_per_user
- **Storage Needed** = Daily_Data × retention_days × redundancy ÷ compression
- **Bandwidth** = Peak_QPS × response_size × 8 ÷ 10^9 × redundancy
- **Storage Cost** = Hot_PB × $276M/PB + Warm_PB × $36M/PB (7.7x difference!)

## 1. QPS FORMULA

| Formula | Twitter Calculation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Off-peak QPS** = (DAU × Requests/user) ÷ 100K | (300M × 20) ÷ 100K = **60,000 QPS** |
| **Peak QPS** = Off-peak × Peak_mult | 60,000 × 4 = **240,000 QPS** |
| **Daily Requests** = Off-peak × 3,600 × avg_hrs + Peak × 3,600 × peak_hrs | (60K × 3.6K × 20) + (240K × 3.6K × 4) = **7.8B requests/day** |
| **Servers** = Peak QPS ÷ Server_capacity | 240,000 ÷ 500 = **480 servers** |
| **With 2X Redundancy** = Servers × 2 | 480 × 2 = **960 servers** |
| **Auto-scale** = Peak_servers - Off-peak_servers | 960 - 240 = **+720 servers for peak_hrs** |

---

## 2. STORAGE FORMULA

| Formula | Twitter Calculation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Daily Data** = DAU × data_per_user | 300M × 10 MB = **3 PB/day** |
| **Retention Total** = Daily_data × retention_days | 3 PB × 1,825 = **5,475 PB** |
| **With Redundancy** = Total × redundancy | 5,475 PB × 2 = **10,950 PB** |
| **With Compression** = With_redundancy ÷ compression_ratio | 10,950 ÷ 1.5 = **7,300 PB final** |
| **Tiered Storage (Hot)** = Daily × 365 × hot_years | 3 PB × 365 × 1 = **1,095 PB** @ $276K/TB/yr |
| **Tiered Storage (Warm)** = Daily × 365 × warm_years | 3 PB × 365 × 4 = **4,380 PB** @ $36K/TB/yr |
| **Total Annual Cost** | Hot: $303M + Warm: $158M = **~$461M/year** |

## 3. BANDWIDTH FORMULA

| Formula | Twitter Calculation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Bytes Per Second** = Peak_QPS × response_size | 240K × 2 KB = **480 MB/sec** |
| **Gbps** = (Bytes/sec × 8) ÷ 10^9 | (480 × 8) ÷ 10^9 = **3.84 Gbps** |
| **With Redundancy** = Gbps × bw_redundancy | 3.84 × 10 = **38.4 Gbps** |
| **Annual Cost** | 38.4 Gbps × $50K/Gbps = **~$2M/year** |

---

## 4. DATABASE CAPACITY FORMULA

| Formula | Twitter Calculation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Write QPS** = Peak_QPS ÷ read_write_ratio | 240K ÷ 11 = **21,818 writes/sec** |
| **Records Per Day** = Write_QPS × 86400 | 21,818 × 86,400 = **1.88B records/day** |
| **Daily Data Volume** = Records × record_size | 1.88B × 500 B = **0.94 TB/day** |
| **Total With Retention** = Daily × 365 × retention_yrs | 0.94 TB × 1,825 = **1.7 PB** |
| **With Index Overhead** = Total × index_mult | 1.7 PB × 1.5 = **2.55 PB** |
| **With Replication** = With_indexes × db_redundancy | 2.55 PB × 2 = **5.1 PB** |
| **Annual Cost** | 5.1 PB × $276K/TB = **~$1.4B/year** (HDD: $184M) |

---

## 5. CACHING LAYER FORMULA

| Formula | Twitter Calculation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Cache Hit Rate** = hit_rate | **80%** of requests from cache |
| **Cache Miss Rate** = 1 - hit_rate | 1 - 0.80 = **20%** miss rate |
| **DB Hits QPS** = Peak_QPS × (1 - hit_rate) | 240K × 0.20 = **48K QPS** (vs 240K!) |
| **Working Set** = DB_size × hot_data_ratio | 5.1 PB × 0.20 = **1.02 PB** |
| **Cache Size** = Working_set × cache_redundancy | 1.02 PB × 2 = **2.04 PB** |
| **Cache Servers** = Cache_size ÷ ram_per_server | 2.04 PB ÷ 0.512 PB = **~4K servers** |
| **DB Load Reduction** = hit_rate | **80%** load reduction |
| **Annual Cost** | 2.04 PB × $1.5K/GB = **~$3M/year** |

## 6. COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE COST BREAKDOWN

| Component | Metric | Cost Formula | Twitter Cost |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Servers** | 960 peak | $50K/500 QPS × (960÷500) | **$48M/year** |
| **Bandwidth** | 38.4 Gbps | $50K/Gbps | **$2M/year** |
| **Database Storage** | 5.1 PB | $276K/TB (SSD) or $36K/TB (HDD) | **$184M/year** (HDD) |

## 7. QUICK DECISION MATRIX

| Question | Formula to Use | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| How many servers? | Peak QPS ÷ capacity | 240K ÷ 500 = 480 |
| How much bandwidth? | QPS × response_size × 8 ÷ 10^9 | 240K × 2KB = 38.4 Gbps |
| How much storage? | Write_QPS × record_size × retention | 21.8K × 500B × 5yr = 5.1 PB |
| How much cache? | DB_size × 20% × 2X | 5.1 PB × 20% × 2 = 2.04 PB |
| Will peak break us? | Peak QPS > (servers × capacity)? | 240K > 480 × 500? NO |
| Availability needed? | Use SLA → downtime conversion | 99.99% = 52 min/year max |
