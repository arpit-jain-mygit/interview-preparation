## Sharding vs Read Replicas

### Sharding

**Sharding** splits your data horizontally across multiple database instances based on a **shard key** (like user ID or region). Each shard holds a different subset of the data.

- **Example:** User IDs 1-1M on Shard A, 1M-2M on Shard B, etc.
- **Benefit:** Scales write capacity and storage — you can handle more data and writes
- **Cost:** Complex routing logic, harder to query across shards, rebalancing is painful

### Read Replicas

**Read Replicas** are exact copies of your entire database that sync from a primary instance. They're for reading only.

- **Example:** Primary DB in US, read replica in EU, another in Asia
- **Benefit:** Distributes read load geographically; low latency for readers in different regions
- **Cost:** Uses more storage (full copy per replica), doesn't help with write scaling

### Key Difference

| Aspect | Sharding | Read Replicas |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Data split** | Yes (partial) | No (full copy) |
| **Write scaling** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (writes still go to primary) |
| **Read scaling** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Complexity** | High | Low |
| **Query any data** | ❌ Hard (need shard key) | ✅ Easy |

**Real-world rule:** Use **read replicas** for read-heavy workloads across geographies. Use **sharding** when your data is too big to fit on one machine or writes are bottlenecking you.
