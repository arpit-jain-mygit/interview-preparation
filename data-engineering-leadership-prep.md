## The 3 Fundamental Questions (Always Ask These First)

When dealing with large data volumes, every solution starts with:

1. **How much data?** — Gigabytes? Terabytes? Petabytes?
2. **How fast does it need to be processed?** — Real-time (seconds)? Near real-time (minutes)? Batch (hours/daily)?
3. **What's it used for?** — Analytics? Machine learning? Dashboards? Another system?

These three questions determine everything about your architecture.

---

## The Mental Model (Data Factory)

```
Raw Data → [Collect] → [Store] → [Process] → [Serve]
                                                  ↓
                                    Dashboards / ML / Apps
```

Each stage has different problems at scale.

## Fundamentals

### Fundamental 1 — Data Size: What Does GB Actually Mean?

#### Start With Something Familiar

A single text message = ~1 KB (kilobyte)

```
1 KB  = 1 text message
1 MB  = 1,000 text messages  (or a small photo)
1 GB  = 1,000,000 text messages  (or a movie)
1 TB  = 1,000 GB  (or 1,000 movies)
1 PB  = 1,000 TB  (or 1,000,000 movies)
```

#### In Rows of Data

A typical data row (user_id, event, timestamp, country) = ~200 bytes

```
1 GB  =  ~5 million rows
1 TB  =  ~5 billion rows
1 PB  =  ~5 trillion rows
```

#### Real Company Examples

| Company | What they generate | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Small startup | User signups, orders | GB/day |
| Mid-size app | Clickstream, logs | TB/day |
| Amazon/Google/Meta | Everything combined | PB/day |

#### The Key Insight: Does GB Fit in One Machine?

Yes. That is the most important thing about GB scale.

```
A normal laptop    → 16 GB RAM
A cloud server     → 256 GB RAM
Your GB dataset    → fits comfortably
```

At GB scale:
- You do NOT need distributed systems
- One machine can handle it
- Solutions are simpler and cheaper

This changes completely at TB and PB.

#### The Real-World Smell Test

When someone says "we have a data problem" — your first question is always:

> "How many GB/TB/PB per day are we generating?"

This single answer tells you:
- Do we need one machine or many?
- What tools are appropriate?
- How complex will this be?

---

### Fundamental 2 — Speed: What Does Real-time Actually Cost You?

#### The Speed Spectrum

```
Real-time          Near Real-time        Batch
(milliseconds       (seconds to           (hours to
 to seconds)         minutes)              days)
     |___________________|___________________|
  Hardest                                Easiest
  Most expensive                    Least expensive
  Most complex                      Least complex
```

#### What Each Speed Means in Practice

**Real-time (milliseconds to seconds)**
- Data is processed as soon as it arrives
- Example: Fraud detection — block a transaction BEFORE it goes through
- Example: Live sports scores updating every second
- You need the answer NOW or it is useless

**Near Real-time (seconds to minutes)**
- Small acceptable delay, but still feels "live"
- Example: Ride-sharing app showing driver location every 10 seconds
- Example: Alerting system that pages oncall within 2 minutes of an error spike
- A small wait is okay, but hours is not

**Batch (hours to days)**
- Data is collected, then processed together in one big job
- Example: Generating yesterday's sales report every morning at 6am
- Example: Training an ML model once a week on last week's data
- Nobody needs this instantly — scheduled is fine

#### The Golden Rule of Speed

> The faster you need data processed, the more it costs — in money, complexity, and engineering effort.

| Speed | Complexity | Cost | Tools Typically Used |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real-time | High | High | Kafka, Flink, Kinesis |
| Near Real-time | Medium | Medium | Kafka, Spark Streaming |
| Batch | Low | Low | Spark, SQL, Airflow |

#### The Interview Trap

Most candidates jump straight to real-time solutions. Interviewers at big companies will push back:

> "Do you actually need real-time, or will 15-minute delay work?"

If 15-minute delay works — batch or near real-time is always the better answer. Simpler, cheaper, easier to maintain.

**Always justify your speed choice.**

### Fundamental 3 — Storage: Where Does Data Live?

#### The Simple Analogy

```
Your pocket          → RAM (fastest, tiny, expensive, disappears when power off)
Your desk            → Local disk (fast, medium size)
Your filing cabinet  → Database (organized, queryable)
A warehouse          → Object Storage like S3 (cheap, massive, not queryable directly)
```

#### The 4 Types You Must Know

**1. Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)**
- Rows and columns, like Excel but powerful
- Great for: reading/writing individual records fast
- Bad for: reading millions of rows at once
- Example: "Get me user #12345's profile"

**2. Data Warehouse (Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake)**
- Built specifically for analytics on large datasets
- Uses columnar storage internally
- Great for: "Give me total sales by country for last 3 months"
- Bad for: real-time inserts, frequent updates

**3. Object Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)**
- Just files sitting in the cloud (CSV, Parquet, JSON)
- Extremely cheap, unlimited size
- Great for: storing raw data, backups, ML training data
- Bad for: querying directly (you need another tool on top)

**4. Message Queue (Kafka, Kinesis)**
- Not permanent storage — a temporary buffer
- Data flows through it like a pipe
- Great for: real-time data movement between systems
- Bad for: long-term storage or querying

#### Which Storage for Which Job?

| Situation | Use This |
|---|---|
| Save a user's order | Database |
| Run monthly sales report | Data Warehouse |
| Store raw logs cheaply | Object Storage (S3) |
| Move data between systems in real-time | Message Queue (Kafka) |

#### When to Use What — CAP Perspective

| Priority | Tool | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| Consistency (C) | PostgreSQL, MySQL | Wrong data causes real damage — payments, inventory, legal |
| Availability (A) | Cassandra, DynamoDB | Being down is worse than stale data — carts, likes, sessions |

Mental test: "What is worse — showing wrong data, or showing nothing at all?"
- Wrong data is worse → Consistency → PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Showing nothing is worse → Availability → Cassandra/DynamoDB

Note: RDBMS = C and NoSQL = A is a good starting rule, but MongoDB defaults to C and MySQL read replicas can serve stale data. The real answer depends on how the database handles network failures internally.

#### Storage at TB and PB Scale

**TB Scale:**
```
TB Data
  |
  ├── Transactional (lookup by key)     →  NoSQL (Cassandra, DynamoDB)
  ├── Analytical (GROUP BY, JOINs)      →  Data Warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift)
  └── Raw storage (cheap, keep all)     →  Object Storage (S3, GCS) + Athena/Spark on top
```

**PB Scale Transactional:**
- NoSQL (Bigtable, Cassandra, DynamoDB) — but partition key design is everything
- Used by: Google (Bigtable for Gmail/Maps), Meta (Cassandra for social graph), Amazon (DynamoDB for orders), Uber/Netflix (Cassandra for trip/viewing history)

#### Partition Key Design

At PB scale, data is split across thousands of machines. The partition key tells the system which machine owns which row.

```
Hash(partition_key) → Machine assignment
Query by partition_key → goes to exactly one machine → milliseconds
Query without partition_key → scans all machines → disaster
```

**Rules for good partition key design:**

1. **High cardinality** — must have many unique values so data spreads evenly
   - user_id (millions of values) ✓
   - country (200 values) ✗ → hot partition
   - boolean (2 values) ✗ → terrible

2. **Match your most frequent query pattern**
   - Most queries are "get by user_id" → partition key = user_id

3. **Avoid time-based keys alone**
   - All current writes pile onto today's machine → hot partition
   - Fix: combine with another field (user_id + date)

**Multiple query patterns → store data multiple times (materialized view pattern)**
```
Copy 1 — partitioned by user_id    → "Get orders for user #5432"
Copy 2 — partitioned by product_id → "Get orders for product #ABC"
Copy 3 — partitioned by date       → "Get all orders placed today"
```
Storage is cheap. Slow queries at PB scale are not acceptable.

**Uber example:** trip data stored 3 ways — by driver_id, by rider_id, by city+date — each serving a different access pattern instantly.

---

#### The GB Scale Insight

At GB scale, a regular database or even a single file often works fine. You do not need a data warehouse yet. This simplicity goes away at TB scale.

#### Columnar Storage — What Problem It Solves

For a query like `SELECT AVG(purchase_amount) FROM users` on 1 billion rows:

- **Row storage** reads every column of every row, then picks only purchase_amount — 5x more data than needed
- **Columnar storage** jumps directly to the purchase_amount column, skips everything else — 5x faster

Additionally, columnar storage compresses similar values together (e.g. numbers), giving 3-10x compression on top.

> Row storage is optimized for **finding one record**. Columnar storage is optimized for **computing across millions of records**.

#### When You Need Both: The Dual Storage Pattern

Common in e-commerce, ride-sharing, streaming — any app that needs:
- Fast individual record lookup (customer's order page) → Row storage
- Fast analytics across millions of rows (monthly revenue report) → Columnar storage

**Solution: store data twice, serve each from the right storage.**

```
Source Data
     |
     ├──→ Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)              ← row-level queries
     └──→ Data Warehouse (BigQuery/Redshift)       ← analytical queries
```

A pipeline copies data from the database to the warehouse with a small delay (minutes to hours), which is acceptable since analytics does not need to be real-time.

| Company | Row Storage Used For | Columnar Storage Used For |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon | Order details page | Revenue reports, demand forecasting |
| Uber | Trip details | Surge pricing analysis, driver analytics |
| Netflix | Watch history page | Content popularity, recommendation model training |

**Modern alternative:** HTAP databases (Google AlloyDB, TiDB, SingleStore) store both formats internally and route queries automatically. Most big companies still prefer dual storage for independent scaling.

#### The Corrected OLTP vs OLAP Mental Model

```
                    OLTP                          OLAP
                (transactional)               (analytical)

Small scale   →  RDBMS (PostgreSQL/MySQL)   →  RDBMS (works for small analytics too)
Large scale   →  NoSQL                      →  Columnar DB
```

**NoSQL by access pattern:**

| Access Pattern | Type | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Single record by ID, ultra-fast | Key-Value | Redis, DynamoDB |
| All records for an entity, high write volume, TB/PB | Wide-Column | Cassandra, HBase, Bigtable |
| Flexible nested structure, varied queries | Document | MongoDB, Firestore |
| Relationship traversal between entities | Graph | Neo4j, Neptune |

**Columnar by speed:**

```
Last few hours, speed critical   →  ClickHouse, Druid   (real-time + near real-time)
Historical, analyst queries      →  Snowflake, BigQuery  (near real-time + batch)
```

**Important:** Partition key concept belongs to NoSQL (Wide-Column), NOT columnar.

```
NoSQL partition key    →  routes query to ONE machine — MUST be in every query
Columnar partitioning  →  optimization hint for parallel reads — optional, any SQL works
```

#### Pure Columnar Databases

| Type | Tools | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud Data Warehouses | BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, Synapse | SQL interface, storage + compute bundled |
| Real-time Columnar | ClickHouse, Apache Druid | Speed-critical, recent data, sub-second queries |
| Open Source / On-Prem | DuckDB, Greenplum, Vertica | Local or enterprise use |
| Columnar File Formats | Parquet, ORC | Files on S3 — need Spark/Athena on top to query |

Key distinction:
- Parquet/ORC = columnar file format, stored in S3, needs compute engine on top
- BigQuery/Snowflake = columnar database, storage + compute bundled, just write SQL

Big companies often use both: raw data as Parquet in S3 → queried by Athena/Spark for ad-hoc work → also loaded into Snowflake for analyst SQL queries.

#### Complete Columnar Use Case — E-commerce (End to End)

**Business:** 50M users, 500 GB new data/day, 5 TB total. Business needs: revenue by category, cart abandonment by city, trending products, campaign performance, inactive users.

**The Full Architecture:**

```
[User Actions on App]
        ↓
[Event Collection - Kafka]  ← absorbs 50K events/sec, buffers spikes
        |
        ├──→ [Flink - Stream Processor]
        |           ↓
        |    [ClickHouse - Real-time Columnar]
        |           ↓ queried by:
        |           ├── Grafana dashboards (auto-refresh every 30s)
        |           ├── Alerting system (every 5 min: error rate? payment failures?)
        |           └── Backend APIs (trending products → cached in Redis → homepage)
        |
        └──→ [S3 - Raw Parquet files] (every 5 min)
                    ↓
             [Spark - Batch Processor] (hourly: clean, deduplicate, join)
                    ↓
             [Snowflake - Historical Columnar]
                    ↓ queried by:
                    └── Tableau/Looker (analysts, business teams, ad-hoc SQL)
```

**What queries what:**

| System | Queries | Latency | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grafana | ClickHouse | <1 sec | Live dashboards during sale events |
| Alerting system | ClickHouse | <1 sec | Error/payment spike detection |
| Backend API | ClickHouse | <1 sec | "Trending Now" product feature |
| Tableau/Looker | Snowflake | 3-10 sec | Analyst reports, historical queries |

**All tools and their roles:**

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| Kafka | Collects events, buffers traffic spikes, feeds both pipelines |
| Flink | Cleans and enriches data in real-time from Kafka |
| ClickHouse | Real-time columnar — last few hours, speed-critical queries |
| S3 | Cheap raw storage (Parquet files) — source of truth |
| Spark | Batch cleaning, deduplication, joins — runs hourly |
| Snowflake | Historical columnar — all analyst queries, reports |
| Airflow | Schedules Spark jobs, monitors failures, retries |
| Tableau/Looker | BI tool — business users explore without writing SQL |
| dbt | Manages SQL transformations inside Snowflake, version controlled |
| Redis | Caches ClickHouse query results for homepage features |

**Feature Store + Batch Population (for ML inference):**

```
Raw Data (S3)
    ↓
Spark batch job (hourly) → computes features (txn_count_30d, avg_amount) → Feature Store (Redis/DynamoDB)
Flink stream job (always) → computes real-time features (txn_count_last_10min) → Feature Store

Inference request → fetch features from Feature Store (2ms) → model predicts → response
```

Lambda Architecture solves stale batch features: batch handles history, stream handles recency, model uses both.

### Fundamental 6 — Use Cases: What Does Each Consumer Need?

#### The 4 Consumers

**1. Analytics**
- Who: Data analysts, business teams
- Question: "What happened and why?"
- Needs: Historical data, aggregations (SUM/COUNT/AVG/GROUP BY), SQL interface, delay acceptable
- Best served by: Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift

**2. Machine Learning**
- Who: Data scientists, ML engineers
- Question: "What will happen next?"
- Needs: Raw individual rows (not aggregated), large historical volume, clean schema
- Two phases:
  - Training → batch, slow okay → **S3 (Parquet) + Spark**
  - Inference → milliseconds → **Feature Store + Redis**

**Feature Store clarification:**

Feature Store = a SYSTEM with 3 components. Redis is only one part of it.

```
Feature Store components:

1. Offline Store  (S3 / Snowflake)
   → historical features for model TRAINING
   → months of data, batch access, slow is fine
   → "train model on last 6 months of restaurant features"

2. Online Store   (Redis / DynamoDB)
   → current features for model INFERENCE
   → latest values only, sub-ms access required
   → "give me restaurant 456's features RIGHT NOW"

3. Feature Registry  (Feast / internal catalog)
   → catalog of what features exist, who owns them
   → "restaurant:avg_prep_time, computed by Spark hourly, source: orders table"
```

Redis = ONLY the Online Store layer. Not the entire Feature Store.

```
Read speeds:
  PostgreSQL  →  5-20ms   (too slow for inference)
  DynamoDB    →  5-10ms   (acceptable at Amazon scale)
  Redis       →  0.1-1ms  (fastest, RAM-based)
```

Why pre-compute features instead of querying at inference time:
```
Option A — compute at inference time:
ML Service queries PostgreSQL, S3, multiple tables → 500ms+ to gather inputs → too slow

Option B — Feature Store:
Spark/Flink pre-compute → store in Redis → ML Service GET in 1ms → predict instantly
```

Managed tools (manage all 3 layers): Feast (open source), AWS SageMaker Feature Store, Tecton

Flink writes real-time features to Redis (active_orders, driver_count) — different keys from Spark.
Spark writes historical features to Redis (avg_prep_time, rating) — no key overlap, no conflict.
Consistency risk: historical features can be stale (up to 1 hour) — acceptable for delivery time prediction, NOT acceptable for fraud detection (use 15-min Spark interval or Flink for those features too).

**3. Dashboards**
- Who: Executives, operations, product managers
- Question: "What is happening right now?"
- Needs: Pre-computed numbers, fast page load (<2 sec), auto-refresh, NOT raw data
- Real-time ops dashboards → **ClickHouse + Grafana**
- Business dashboards → **Snowflake + Tableau/Looker**

**4. Another System**
- Who: Other microservices, APIs
- Question: "Give me clean data I can act on immediately"
- Needs: Structured format, low latency, exactly-once delivery, stable schema
- Best served by: **Kafka (event-driven) or NoSQL (DynamoDB/Cassandra)**

#### Side by Side

| Consumer | Who | Question Type | Latency Need | Best Tool |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Analytics | Analysts | What happened? | Hours okay | Snowflake/BigQuery |
| ML Training | Data Scientists | Pattern learning | Hours okay | S3 + Spark |
| ML Inference | ML Engineers | What will happen? | Milliseconds | Feature Store + Redis |
| Dashboards (ops) | Operations | What's happening now? | Seconds | ClickHouse + Grafana |
| Dashboards (business) | Executives | Business metrics | Minutes | Snowflake + Tableau |
| Another System | Engineers | Give me clean data | Milliseconds | Kafka / NoSQL |

#### Same Data, Different Architecture Per Consumer

Uber trip data — one dataset, six consumers:
```
Raw trip data
    |
    ├── Analytics team        → Snowflake   "Revenue by city last month"
    ├── ML training           → S3/Spark    "Train surge pricing model"
    ├── ML inference          → Redis       "Predict surge for this zone now"
    ├── Ops dashboard         → ClickHouse  "Active trips right now"
    ├── Executive dashboard   → Snowflake   "Weekly business metrics"
    └── Payment service       → Kafka       "Trip completed → charge rider"
```

#### The Leadership Insight

> Always ask "who is consuming this data?" before designing anything. Wrong answer: "I'll put everything in Snowflake." Right answer: "It depends on who needs it and how fast."

---

### All 6 Fundamentals — Summary

| Fundamental | Core Question | Key Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Data Size | How much? | GB = one machine. TB/PB = many machines |
| 2. Speed | How fast? | Faster = more expensive. Always justify your choice |
| 3. Storage | Where? | Right storage for right job. Never one size fits all |
| 4. Processing | How transformed? | GB = SQL/Python. TB/PB = Spark distributed |
| 5. CAP Trade-off | C or A? | Wrong data worse → C. Going down worse → A |
| 6. Use Cases | Who consumes? | Consumer determines everything about your design |

### Scenario 1 — GB + Real-time + Analytics

#### Problem Statement
```
Size:    5 GB/day, ~25M events/day
Speed:   Real-time — answers needed in seconds
Use:     Analytics — "Orders by city right now? Which restaurant is spiking?"
Who:     Food delivery startup ops team
```

                                      auto-refresh 10 sec
```

#### Quick Recap — New Concepts Introduced
```
PostgreSQL  → OLTP source of truth (synchronous, ACID)
Debezium    → CDC: reads WAL after confirmed write, no dual write risk
Kafka       → event bus (decouples producers from consumers)
Flink       → real-time aggregation (stateful, RAM-based)
ClickHouse  → real-time OLAP (pre-aggregated rows, <10ms queries)
S3          → raw Parquet storage (permanent, cheap)
```

#### Key Design Decisions

**Why not App → Kafka directly?**
```
Dual write risk: PostgreSQL down but Kafka up → payment charged, no order saved
Fix: App writes ONLY to PostgreSQL. Debezium reads WAL after confirmed write.
```

**Why not App → Kafka → PostgreSQL?**
```
Async gap: customer sees "confirmed" before order actually saved in PostgreSQL
Consumer crash = order lost. Only valid for non-customer-facing async work.
```

**Why ClickHouse not PostgreSQL for analytics?**
```
Continuous aggregation every 10 sec = full table scan = CPU spikes on PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is already handling OLTP — analytical queries steal resources
ClickHouse dedicated machine: <10ms on pre-aggregated rows, zero OLTP impact
```

#### CDC Deep Dive
```
WAL (Write Ahead Log) — PostgreSQL writes every change here automatically
Debezium reads WAL → publishes to Kafka as events:
{ operation: INSERT, table: orders, new_data: { order_id: 98765, amount: 450 } }

CDC properties:
  App stays simple     → writes only to PostgreSQL, zero knowledge of consumers
  No dual write        → CDC reads AFTER confirmed write, failed write = nothing published
  Guaranteed ordering  → WAL is strictly ordered: placed → preparing → delivered
  No data loss         → Kafka down 2 hrs? Debezium catches up from WAL on return
```

#### Tool Summary

| Tool | Role | READ/WRITE |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | OLTP source of truth | App WRITEs, Debezium READs WAL |
| Debezium | CDC connector | READs WAL, WRITEs Kafka |
| Kafka | Event bus | Consumers READ |
| Payment/Driver Service | OLTP consumers | READ Kafka |
| Flink | Real-time aggregation | READs Kafka, WRITEs ClickHouse |
| ClickHouse | Real-time OLAP store | Flink WRITEs, Grafana READs |
| S3 | Raw storage | Kafka WRITEs |
| Grafana | Ops dashboard | READs ClickHouse |

#### GB Scale Reality
```
PostgreSQL  → $50/month   Kafka → $30/month
Flink       → $50/month   ClickHouse → $50/month
Total: ~$200/month, managed by 1 engineer part-time
```

#### Interview Answer
```
1. App WRITEs to PostgreSQL (single source of truth)
2. Debezium CDC READs WAL → WRITEs to Kafka
3. Kafka routes to: Payment Service, Driver Service, Flink
4. Flink aggregates every 10 sec → WRITEs to ClickHouse
5. Grafana READs ClickHouse → live ops dashboard
6. Kafka also WRITEs raw events to S3 for historical analysis

Key insight: "CDC via Debezium — app writes once, everything follows automatically."
```

#### Interview Questions

**Q1. Why not write directly from app to Kafka?**
```
Kafka is not a database (7-day retention, no ACID). Dual write risk: if PostgreSQL
write fails after Kafka write succeeds → payment charged, no order exists.
CDC solves: app writes ONLY to PostgreSQL, Debezium reads WAL after confirmed write.
```

**Q2. Dashboard showing stale data — how to debug?**
```
1. Kafka lag growing? → app not writing OR Flink falling behind
2. Flink running? → check job status, checkpoint, backpressure
   Backpressure = slow ClickHouse writes signal Flink to slow down → Kafka lag grows
3. ClickHouse last write timestamp → if old, Flink→ClickHouse connector broken
4. Cross-check: add Grafana panel "last data received X seconds ago"
```

**Q3. How to handle 10x traffic spike during sale?**

| Component | Handles 10x? | Fix | Pre-sale Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| App servers | No | Auto-scale (Kubernetes) | Pre-warm servers |
| PostgreSQL | Partially | Read replicas + PgBouncer | Vertical scale |
| Debezium | Yes (may lag) | Acceptable, catches up | Increase heap |
| Kafka | Yes — built for this | Increase partitions + retention | Pre-provision disk |
| Flink | Partially | Increase parallelism BEFORE sale | Scale cluster ahead |
| ClickHouse | Yes at GB scale | Batch writes if needed | Monitor write rate |
| S3 | Yes — infinite | Nothing needed | None |
| Spark | Partially | More executors, run more often | Pre-scale cluster |

```
Golden Rule: cannot fix most things DURING spike. Prepare BEFORE.
Read Replicas: Primary streams WAL to replicas (same WAL Debezium reads).
  Async replication: 10-100ms lag. Risk: driver queries replica before order appears.
  Fix: read-your-own-writes (route user's next read to Primary after their write).
PgBouncer: 50 servers × 20 connections = 1000 → exceeds PostgreSQL max_connections.
  PgBouncer multiplexes: app sees 1000 connections, PostgreSQL sees 20-50.

Leadership insight: "Kafka absorbs spike downstream but upstream bottleneck is app
servers and PostgreSQL. Flink needs pre-scaling — parallelism cannot change at runtime.
Only truly elastic component is S3."
```

**Q4. Junior suggests PostgreSQL for analytics to reduce complexity. Response?**
```
Valid at GB scale IF: query runs once/day, simple queries, no concurrent load.
Fails here: Grafana queries every 30 sec = continuous full table scan = CPU spikes
+ OLTP and OLAP compete on same machine = order placement slows during analytics.
Start with PostgreSQL, switch to ClickHouse when refresh < 1 min or team grows.
```

### Scenario 2 — GB + Real-time + ML

#### Problem Statement
```
Size:    5 GB/day, ~25M events/day
Speed:   Real-time — ML prediction in milliseconds
Use:     ML Inference — "Predict delivery time before confirmation screen loads"
Who:     Food delivery startup — prediction shown simultaneously with order confirmation

```

#### Quick Recap — New Concepts Introduced
```
Redis          → Feature Store online layer (sub-ms point lookups)
ML Service     → pulls from Redis on demand, runs model, responds synchronously
Feature Store  → system with 3 layers:
                 Offline Store (S3) — historical features for training
                 Online Store (Redis) — current features for inference
                 Feature Registry — catalog of features, ownership
Lambda Architecture → Flink (recency) + Spark (history) both write to Redis
                      model reads both at inference time
Lambda Architecture ≠ AWS Lambda (serverless functions)
```

#### Key Design Decisions

**Two parallel calls from App:**
```
Call 1: WRITE → PostgreSQL      (~20ms) — saves order
Call 2: REQUEST → ML Service    (~15ms) — gets prediction
App waits for BOTH → "Order confirmed! Arrives in 28 minutes"
App never touches Redis directly — ML Service handles that internally.
```

**Why not Kafka for ML Inference?**
```
Kafka = PUSH (sends data when events arrive)
ML Inference = PULL (needs features for specific user ON DEMAND)
1000 concurrent orders → each needs different features for different user/restaurant
Redis: 1000 point lookups in parallel in <1ms each
Kafka cannot answer "give me current state for restaurant_456" on demand
```

**Why Flink does not slow down:**
```
Flink keeps running state in RAM — not recount from scratch:
Event: order placed at Pizza Palace
Flink: state["Pizza Palace"] = current + 1  ← microseconds, not a full scan
Writes updated value to Redis every 30 sec
Checkpoints state to S3 every 30 sec (crash recovery)
```

**Feature Store consistency — Flink vs Spark:**
```
Flink writes: restaurant:456:active_orders (TTL=2min) — real-time keys
Spark writes: restaurant:456:avg_prep_time (TTL=2hr) — historical keys
Different keys → no conflict. No overwrite risk.

Staleness risk: historical features up to 1 hour old.
Acceptable: delivery time prediction (minor inaccuracy)
NOT acceptable: fraud detection → use 15-min Spark interval or Flink for those keys too
```

#### GB Scale Reality
```
PostgreSQL → $50   Kafka+Debezium → $30   Flink → $50
Redis → $30        Spark → $20            ML Service → $50   S3 → $10
Total: ~$240/month
```

#### Interview Answer
```
1. App makes 2 parallel calls: WRITE to PostgreSQL + REQUEST to ML Service
2. Debezium CDC READs WAL → WRITEs Kafka
3. Kafka → Payment/Driver (OLTP) + Flink + S3
4. Flink READs Kafka → state in RAM → WRITEs real-time features to Redis
5. Spark READs S3 hourly → WRITEs historical features to Redis
6. ML Service READs Redis → model → RESPONSE "28 min" to App

Key insight: "Lambda Architecture — Flink for recency, Spark for history, Redis serves both.
App never touches Redis. ML Service is the only Redis reader."
```

#### Interview Questions

**Q1. Why Lambda Architecture — isn't it complex?**
```
Batch only (Spark hourly): features 1 hour stale → fraud in 10 min not caught
Stream only (Flink): cannot compute "avg_prep_time over 3 months" — state too large
Lambda: Flink handles last 5 min, Spark handles last 3 months, model uses both.

Alternative — Kappa Architecture (stream only):
Simpler but Flink state complex for long windows. Choose if historical window < 1 day.
```

**Q2. ML predictions suddenly inaccurate — how to debug?**
```
1. Feature freshness: Is Flink writing to Redis? Check Redis TTL on keys.
   Is Spark running? Check Airflow. Stale features = bad predictions.
2. Feature drift: restaurant added items → avg_prep_time formula outdated.
   Fix: monitor feature distribution, alert on shifts.
3. Model drift: world changed (new city, lockdown) → retrain on recent data.

Immediate mitigation: fall back to rule-based prediction (distance/avg_speed).
Long term: shadow mode — run new model alongside old before switching.
```

**Q3. Feature Store consistent between Flink and Spark writes?**
```
Different keys — no conflict. TTL design prevents stale data confusion.
Real-time (Flink): TTL=2min. Historical (Spark): TTL=2hr.
Fraud detection exception: needs 15-min Spark OR Flink computes rolling avg too.
```

**Q4. PM wants prediction for 50M global users — how does design change?**
```
Redis → Redis Cluster or DynamoDB (auto-scales, 10ms reads)
ML Service → auto-scaling fleet behind load balancer (stateless, easy to scale)
Flink → cluster with higher parallelism
Spark → EMR/Databricks distributed

Architecture pattern stays identical. Only scale configuration changes.
```

### Scenario 3 — GB + Real-time + Dashboards

#### Problem Statement
```
Size:    5 GB/day, ~25M events/day
Speed:   Real-time ops (30 sec refresh) + Near real-time business (15-30 min delay)
Use:     Two dashboards — ops team watching live + business team exploring history
Who:     Food delivery startup — sale event monitoring + weekly business reviews

                                       every 30s
```

#### Quick Recap — New Concepts Introduced
```
ClickHouse  → real-time OLAP (ops dashboards, last few hours, <10ms)
Snowflake   → historical OLAP (business dashboards, weeks of data, 3-10 sec)
Grafana     → ops visualization (auto-refresh, time-series panels, engineers)
Tableau     → business visualization (drag-drop exploration, executives)
Two stacks  → Speed Stack (Kafka+Flink+ClickHouse) and Scale Stack (S3+Spark+Snowflake)
```

#### Key Design Decisions

**Two dashboard types — never use one tool for both:**
```
Ops Dashboard (ClickHouse + Grafana):
  Who: ops team, oncall engineers
  Q: "What is happening RIGHT NOW?"
  Refresh: every 30 sec, load in <2 sec
  Data: last few hours only

Business Dashboard (Snowflake + Tableau):
  Who: executives, product managers
  Q: "How are we doing TODAY vs last week?"
  Delay: 15-30 min acceptable
  Data: weeks/months of history
```

**Why not Snowflake for ops dashboard?**
```
Cold query = 3-10 sec minimum. Shared with analysts → contention during sale.
Cost: per-query compute billing × 120 queries/hour = expensive.
ClickHouse: always warm, fixed $50/month, zero contention, <10ms.
```

**Why not ClickHouse for business dashboard?**
```
Holds only last few hours. No joins across user/restaurant/driver tables.
Cannot answer: "revenue by category, last 4 weeks, broken down by city"
Snowflake: holds months of clean joined data, answers in 5-8 sec.
```

**Why no Redis between ClickHouse and Grafana?**
```
Primary reason — wrong access pattern:
  Redis = key-value. No time ranges, no aggregations, no GROUP BY.
  Grafana needs: SELECT city, COUNT(*) WHERE timestamp > NOW()-5MIN GROUP BY city
  Redis cannot execute this. Not what it is built for.

Secondary reason — low query volume:
  Grafana: 120 queries/hour. ClickHouse handles thousands/sec. No caching needed.

How "load in 2 sec" achieved:
  Flink writes pre-aggregated rows (50 rows, not 25M events)
  ClickHouse reads 50 rows → <10ms
  Grafana renders → <500ms
  Total: well under 2 sec

Add Redis between ClickHouse and consumers ONLY when:
  SAME result needed by MANY concurrent users (10,000 users/sec homepage)
  Result changes slowly (cache is safe)
  Redis stores the aggregated result as a BLOB, not a query result
  → SET "trending_products" = "[A, B, C...]" → GET by all 10,000 users
```

#### GB Scale Reality
```
PostgreSQL → $50   Kafka+Debezium → $30   Flink → $50   ClickHouse → $50
Spark → $20        Snowflake → $50         S3 → $10
Total: ~$260/month
```

#### Interview Answer
```
1. App WRITEs to PostgreSQL (OLTP)
2. Debezium CDC → Kafka → Payment/Driver (OLTP)
3. Kafka → Flink → pre-aggregated results → ClickHouse
4. Grafana READs ClickHouse every 30s → ops team live view
5. Kafka → S3 → Spark hourly → clean joined data → Snowflake
6. Tableau READs Snowflake → business team explores history

Key insight: "Two tools for two consumers. ClickHouse: speed, last few hours, dedicated.
Snowflake: history, flexible SQL, shared. Never compromise either for the other."
```

#### Interview Questions

**Q1. Why not Snowflake for both dashboards?**
```
Cold start 3-10 sec, shared with analysts = contention during sale event.
ClickHouse: always warm, dedicated, <10ms. Fixed cost vs per-query billing.
```

**Q2. Dashboard shows order drop — real issue or pipeline problem?**
```
1. Check Kafka: app still producing events? No → real business issue.
2. Check Flink: running? consumer lag growing? Stopped → pipeline issue.
3. Check ClickHouse: when was last write? Old → Flink→ClickHouse broken.
4. Cross-check PostgreSQL directly:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 5 MIN
   PostgreSQL normal → pipeline issue. PostgreSQL also low → real issue.
Always add panel: "Pipeline health: last data received X seconds ago"
```

**Q3. How to design alerting?**
```
Business alerts (ClickHouse → Grafana Alert):
  orders_count < 100 in last 5 min during lunch → page oncall
  payment_failure_rate > 5% last 10 min → page oncall

Pipeline alerts:
  last_clickhouse_write > 2 min → "Dashboard data stale"
  Flink checkpoint failed → "Stream processing issue"
  Kafka consumer lag > 100K → "Processing falling behind"

Route separately: business alerts → ops Slack. Pipeline alerts → data eng oncall.
```

**Q4. Data scientist wants to run ML experiments on live data?**
```
Never give direct ClickHouse access — one heavy query = dashboard breaks during sale.
Option 1: Snowflake (already exists, 1-hour delay acceptable for experiments)
Option 2: S3 + Databricks notebook (reads raw data, no shared production resources)
Governance: ClickHouse = dedicated ops. Snowflake/S3 = DS/analysts. DB = app only.
```

```

#### Quick Recap — New Concepts Introduced
```
Schema Registry    → validates Kafka message schemas, prevents breaking changes
Consumer Groups    → each system has own offset, fully independent read pace
Idempotency Check  → prevents duplicate notifications on Kafka replay
DLQ                → Dead Letter Queue, stores failed events for retry
Exactly-Once       → Kafka default = at-least-once. Idempotency = exactly-once behavior
Fraud Service      → synchronous HTTP (not Kafka) — must respond BEFORE order confirmed
```

#### Key Design Decisions

**Fraud detection is synchronous HTTP, not Kafka:**
```
Kafka = async. You publish event and move on. No way to wait for a response.
Fraud must BLOCK order confirmation — cannot proceed without a score.
Pattern: App → HTTP → Fraud Service → Redis features → score → RESPOND in <200ms
Order enters Kafka pipeline ONLY after fraud check passes.
```

**Exactly-once delivery (Kafka gives at-least-once by default):**
```
Problem: Notification Service crashes after sending push notification,
         before committing Kafka offset. Kafka replays event. Duplicate push sent.

Fix — Idempotency Check:
1. CHECK PostgreSQL: SELECT * FROM notifications_sent WHERE order_id=98765
   → exists? → skip (already sent)
   → not exists? → send → INSERT record
2. Commit Kafka offset

Even if crash replays event → check catches it → no duplicate
```

**Schema Registry prevents silent breaking changes:**
```
Producer registers schema → Consumer validates schema version ID in each message
Adding optional field   → backward compatible → allowed
Renaming field          → breaking change    → blocked until consumers updated
Process: notify consumers → deploy consumers handling both → deploy producer → cleanup
```

**Consumer Group isolation:**
```
Notification Service offset: Partition 0: 1,523  Partition 1: 987
Inventory Service offset:    Partition 0: 1,521  Partition 1: 990

Completely independent. Notification slow → does not block Inventory.
Inventory crashes → does not affect Notification.
```

**Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):**
```
Push notification service is down → event processing fails
Main consumer: moves failed event to "order-events-dlq" topic
DLQ consumer: retries with exponential backoff (1min → 5min → 30min → 2hr)
After 5 failures → alert data engineering team
Main consumer: unblocked, continues processing new events
```

#### Tool Summary

| Tool | Role | READ/WRITE |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | OLTP + idempotency store | App WRITEs, Debezium READs WAL, Services WRITE idempotency |
| Debezium | CDC connector | READs WAL, WRITEs Kafka |
| Kafka | Event bus with consumer isolation | Each service READs own offset |
| Schema Registry | Schema validation | Producers WRITE schema, consumers READ/validate |
| Notification Service | Sends push notifications | READs Kafka, WRITEs idempotency to PostgreSQL |
| Inventory Service | Decrements stock | READs Kafka, WRITEs inventory DB |
| Loyalty Service | Adds points | READs Kafka, WRITEs loyalty DB |
| Fraud Service | Scores transactions synchronously | READs Redis, RESPONDs to App |
| Redis | Fraud features (pre-computed by Flink) | Flink WRITEs, Fraud Service READs |
| DLQ | Failed event retry store | Kafka WRITEs failed events, DLQ consumer READs |

#### GB Scale Reality
```
PostgreSQL → $50   Kafka+Debezium+Schema Registry → $30
Notification/Inventory/Loyalty Services → $30 each
Fraud Service → $50   Redis → $30
Total: ~$220/month
```

#### Interview Answer
```
1. App WRITEs to PostgreSQL (OLTP, synchronous)
2. App makes parallel REQUEST to Fraud Service (synchronous HTTP, <200ms)
   → Fraud READs Redis features → scores → RESPONDs
   → Fraud > 0.8: reject. Clean: proceed.
3. Debezium CDC READs WAL → WRITEs Kafka
4. Multiple consumer groups READ Kafka independently:
   → Notification: idempotency check → send push → WRITE record to PostgreSQL
   → Inventory: decrement stock
   → Loyalty: add points
5. Schema Registry validates all messages
6. DLQ handles failures with exponential backoff

Key insight: "Fraud is synchronous HTTP — must respond before order confirmed.
Everything else is async Kafka. Idempotency = exactly-once behavior from at-least-once system."
```

#### Interview Questions

**Q1. How to ensure no duplicate notifications?**
```
Idempotency check pattern:
Before processing: SELECT * FROM notifications_sent WHERE order_id=X AND type=Y
→ exists → skip. Not exists → send → INSERT → commit Kafka offset.

Even if service crashes and Kafka replays → check catches duplicate.
This converts Kafka's at-least-once into exactly-once behavior.
```

**Q2. New team wants to consume order events — how to onboard?**
```
1. Create new consumer group — completely isolated from existing consumers
2. Register with Schema Registry — get notified of schema changes
3. Set up DLQ for their service
4. Start consuming from earliest offset if they need historical catchup
5. They never touch Kafka topic configuration — isolated by design

No impact on Notification, Inventory, or Loyalty Services whatsoever.
```

**Q3. How to handle 10x traffic spike?**

| Component | Handles 10x? | Fix | Pre-event Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| App servers | No | Auto-scale (Kubernetes) | Pre-warm |
| PostgreSQL | Partially | Read replicas + PgBouncer | Vertical scale |
| Debezium | Yes (may lag) | Catches up from WAL | Increase heap |
| Kafka | Yes — built for this | Increase partitions | Pre-provision disk |
| Schema Registry | Yes | Stateless, cache locally | Pre-scale |
| Notification Service | No | Scale horizontally (stateless) | Pre-scale |
| Fraud Service | No | Scale + Redis cluster | Pre-scale Redis |
| Redis | Partially | Redis Cluster or ElastiCache | Pre-scale |
| DLQ | Yes | More partitions if needed | Pre-provision |

```
Golden Rule: Kafka absorbs spike downstream. Upstream bottleneck = App + PostgreSQL + Fraud.
Redis single machine is risk — pre-cluster before sale.
Fraud Service response time must stay <200ms even at 10x — scale it aggressively.
All consumer services are stateless → easy horizontal scaling.

Leadership insight: "Most consumers are stateless and trivially auto-scale.
Real risks are Fraud latency SLA and Redis. Both must be pre-scaled before event."
```

**Q4. Team argues Kafka alone is enough — no need for PostgreSQL as OLTP source?**
```
Kafka is NOT a database:
- 7-day retention → can't query order placed 30 days ago
- No random reads by order_id
- No transactions — if Kafka write succeeds but downstream fails, no rollback
- Dual write risk: if app writes to Kafka and PostgreSQL separately → one can fail

CDC pattern: app writes ONLY to PostgreSQL (ACID guaranteed).
Debezium reads WAL AFTER confirmed write → no dual write.
PostgreSQL = source of truth. Kafka = event bus. Never conflate the two.
```

## Reference — Tool Stacks and Counterparts

### The Two Standard Stacks

```
SPEED STACK                     SCALE STACK
───────────                     ───────────
Kafka                           Kafka
  ↓                               ↓
Flink                           S3
  ↓                               ↓
ClickHouse/Druid/Pinot          Spark
  ↓                               ↓
Grafana / Product UI            Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift
                                  ↓
                                Tableau / Looker
```

Same Kafka feeds both. Everything else is parallel.

### When to Choose Which Real-time Store

```
Internal ops dashboard, GB-TB, simple:         Flink + ClickHouse
Internal ops dashboard, TB-PB, multi-tenant:   Flink + Druid
User-facing analytics in product:              Flink + Pinot
Historical analyst queries:                    Spark + Snowflake
ML inference serving:                          Flink/Spark + Redis
All of the above (mature platform):            Kafka feeds all
```

### Columnar File Formats — Parquet and ORC

#### What Is a File Format?

How data is physically arranged on disk/S3. Determines read speed, file size, and tool compatibility.

```
.csv     → row format, plain text, no compression (baseline)
.parquet → columnar format, compressed, fast for analytics
.orc     → columnar format, compressed, Hadoop ecosystem
```

#### How Parquet Stores Data

```
CSV (row format on disk):
[1,Mumbai,450,delivered] [2,Delhi,200,placed] [3,Bangalore,800,delivered]

Parquet (columnar on disk):
order_id column:  [1, 2, 3]
city column:      [Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore]
amount column:    [450, 200, 800]
status column:    [delivered, placed, delivered]
```

Parquet splits files into **Row Groups**, each with a footer storing min/max stats per column:

```
Query: WHERE amount > 1000

Footer says:
  Row Group 1: amount min=50,  max=900   → SKIP entirely
  Row Group 2: amount min=200, max=5000  → READ

= skips entire row groups without reading them (predicate pushdown)
```

#### Compression

Similar values stored together compress extremely well:

```
status column: [delivered, delivered, placed, delivered, placed]
→ Run-length encoding: (delivered,3),(placed,1),(delivered,1)
→ 60-70% smaller

Result:
CSV:     1 GB
Parquet: 100-200 MB  (5-10x smaller)
```

#### Parquet vs ORC

| Feature | Parquet | ORC |
|---|---|---|
| Created for | Spark, general purpose | Hive, Hadoop ecosystem |
| Ecosystem | Spark, Flink, Athena, BigQuery, Snowflake | Hive, Spark, Presto |
| Adoption | More widely used today | Common in older Hadoop stacks |
| Default choice | Yes | Only if using Hive/Hadoop |

**Rule:** If unsure → always choose Parquet.

#### How Parquet Fits in Architecture

```
[Kafka] ──WRITE──→ [S3]                    ← raw JSON (large, slow)
                      │
                    READ
                      │
                   [Spark]                  ← cleans, converts format
                      │
                    WRITE
                      │
                   [S3]                     ← clean Parquet (small, fast)
                      │
                    READ
                      │
          [Snowflake / Athena / Spark]      ← queries only needed columns
```

#### Why Not Store as JSON in S3?

```
Athena charges per byte scanned:
JSON query on 5 GB:     reads 5 GB   → $25/query
Parquet query on 5 GB:  reads 200 MB → $1/query

Speed: Parquet is 10-50x faster for analytical queries
```

#### No Primary Key in Columnar Storage

Columnar storage never looks up individual rows — it scans entire columns. No primary key needed.

Speed comes from:
- Physical column separation (read only needed columns)
- Predicate pushdown (skip row groups via min/max stats)
- Compression (less data to read from disk)

ClickHouse uses ORDER BY for physical sorting instead of primary key:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (order_id UInt64, city String, amount Float64)
ORDER BY (city, created_at)   -- no primary key, just sort order
```

### Flink → ClickHouse vs Flink → Redis vs Flink → ClickHouse → Redis

| Pattern | When | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| Flink → ClickHouse | Many viewers, time-range queries, aggregations | Grafana, alerts, dashboards |
| Flink → Redis | One system, key lookup, sub-ms response | ML inference, rate limiter, sessions |
| Flink → ClickHouse → Redis | ClickHouse result queried too frequently, need caching | High-traffic product features, homepages |

**Flink → ClickHouse:**
```
Use when: "SUM(orders) GROUP BY city for last 5 minutes"
Many consumers query same aggregated result over time ranges
Redis cannot do this — no time ranges, no aggregations
```

**Flink → Redis:**
```
Use when: "give me features for user USR-123 RIGHT NOW"
One system, one key, one value, <1ms response needed
ML inference, rate limiting, session storage
ClickHouse minimum 10-50ms — too slow for ML inference at scale
```

**Flink → ClickHouse → Redis (caching pattern):**
```
Problem: 10,000 users/sec hitting homepage → 10,000 ClickHouse queries/sec → overload

Solution:
Flink → ClickHouse (aggregates continuously)
Backend service queries ClickHouse every 2 min → WRITEs result to Redis (TTL=2min)
Homepage READs from Redis (0.1ms) → ClickHouse gets 1 query per 2 min instead of 10,000/sec

Example: "Trending Now" section — computed in ClickHouse, cached in Redis, served to millions

## MAANG Interview Questions — Scenario 1, 2, 3

### Scenario 1 — GB + Real-time + Analytics

**Q1. Walk me through how you would design a real-time analytics pipeline for a food delivery app generating 5GB/day.**
```
1. Events → PostgreSQL (OLTP, source of truth)
2. Debezium CDC reads WAL → Kafka (no dual write risk)
3. Kafka fans out to: Payment Service, Driver Service, Flink
4. Flink aggregates every 10 sec → ClickHouse
5. Grafana queries ClickHouse → live ops dashboard
6. Kafka also writes raw events to S3 for historical analysis

Key decision: CDC via Debezium — app writes once, everything follows automatically.
```

**Q2. Why not write directly from the app to Kafka instead of going through PostgreSQL first?**
```
Two problems with App → Kafka directly:

1. Kafka is not a database:
   - 7-day retention only, no random reads, no ACID

2. Dual write problem:
   - App writes to PostgreSQL AND Kafka separately
   - Kafka write fails after PostgreSQL succeeds → order saved, payment never notified
   - PostgreSQL write fails after Kafka succeeds → payment charged, no order exists

CDC solves this:
   - App writes ONLY to PostgreSQL
   - Debezium reads WAL AFTER confirmed write
   - Impossible to notify downstream for a failed write
```

**Q3. Your ClickHouse dashboard is showing stale data. How do you debug?**
```
Step 1 — Check Kafka consumer lag:
→ Growing lag = app not writing OR Flink falling behind

Step 2 — Check Flink job status:
→ Running/failed/restarting?
→ Check Flink checkpoint status (stuck = processing paused)
→ Check Flink backpressure (slow ClickHouse writes = upstream slowdown)
   Flink backpressure = slow downstream component signals upstream to slow down
   Kafka lag grows → Flink is processing slowly → ClickHouse is the bottleneck

Step 3 — Check ClickHouse insert rate:
→ Last write timestamp → if 10 min ago, Flink→ClickHouse connector broken

Step 4 — Check Grafana:
→ Data source connection, time range filter, timezone

Most common root cause: Flink job silently failed and restarting
Fix: add alerting on Flink job health + pipeline staleness panel in Grafana
```

**Q4. How would you handle a 10x traffic spike during a sale event?**

| Component | Handles 10x? | Fix | Pre-sale Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| App servers | No — overloads | Auto-scale (Kubernetes) | Pre-warm servers |
| PostgreSQL | Partially — reads bottleneck | Read replicas + PgBouncer | Vertical scale, tune connections |
| Debezium | Yes — may lag slightly | Acceptable lag, catches up | Increase heap memory |
| Kafka | Yes — designed for this | Increase partitions + retention | Pre-provision disk |
| Flink | Partially — needs pre-scaling | Increase parallelism BEFORE sale | Scale cluster ahead of event |
| ClickHouse | Yes at GB scale | Batch writes if needed | Monitor write rate |
| S3 | Yes — infinitely scalable | Nothing needed | None |
| Spark | Partially — job takes longer | More executors, run more often | Pre-scale cluster |

```
Read Replicas — how they stay updated:
Primary PostgreSQL writes to WAL automatically.
WAL serves two consumers simultaneously:
  1. Debezium → reads WAL → publishes to Kafka (CDC)
  2. Read Replica → reads WAL → applies changes to itself (replication)

Async replication (default): replica lags 10-100ms behind primary
Sync replication: zero lag but every write waits for replica confirmation

Risk — replication lag:
  Order placed at 11:32:45.000 on Primary
  Replica has it at 11:32:45.087
  Driver queries Replica at 11:32:45.050 → "order not found"
  Fix: read-your-own-writes (route user's next read to Primary after their write)

PgBouncer — connection pooling:
  50 app servers × 20 connections = 1000 connections → PostgreSQL max_connections=100 → crash
  PgBouncer: app connects to PgBouncer (handles 1000) → PgBouncer maintains 20-50 to PostgreSQL
```

```
Golden Rule for sale events:
Cannot fix most things DURING the spike. Everything must be prepared BEFORE.

Pre-sale checklist:
□ Load test at 20x expected traffic
□ Pre-warm app servers
□ Scale Flink parallelism (cannot change at runtime without job restart)
□ Increase Kafka partitions and retention
□ Add PostgreSQL read replicas + PgBouncer
□ Increase Spark cluster size
□ Brief oncall, set up war room, define rollback plan

Leadership insight:
"Kafka absorbs the spike for downstream — but bottleneck is upstream:
app servers and PostgreSQL need pre-scaling.
Flink needs pre-scaling too — parallelism cannot change at runtime.
Only truly elastic component is S3. Everything else requires pre-sale preparation."
```

**Q5. Junior engineer suggests using PostgreSQL for analytics to reduce complexity. How do you respond?**
```
Valid concern — complexity should be justified.

PostgreSQL works for analytics IF:
- Query runs once a day (not every 30 sec)
- Simple queries, small team, no concurrent analytical load

Fails here because:
1. Grafana queries every 30 sec = continuous load
2. PostgreSQL already handling OLTP — analytical queries compete
3. Full table scan every 30 sec = CPU spikes = order placement slows

ClickHouse justification:
- Dedicated machine = zero OLTP impact
- Pre-aggregated rows = <10ms vs seconds on PostgreSQL
- Cost: $50/month — justified by reliability

Recommendation: start with PostgreSQL if GB scale and low frequency.
Switch to ClickHouse when dashboard refresh < 1 min or team grows.
```

### Scenario 2 — GB + Real-time + ML

**Q1. How would you design a real-time delivery time prediction system alongside order processing?**
```
Two parallel paths:

Path 1 — OLTP:
App → PostgreSQL → Debezium → Kafka → Payment/Driver services

Path 2 — ML Inference (parallel HTTP call):
App → ML Inference Service → reads Redis → runs model → returns prediction

Feature Store feeds Redis via Lambda Architecture:
- Flink (stream): active_orders, driver_count → Redis every 30 sec
- Spark (batch hourly): avg_prep_time, user_history → Redis

App calls both paths simultaneously.
Customer sees confirmed order + delivery time at the same moment.
```

**Q2. Why use Lambda Architecture? Isn't it complex?**
```
Batch only (Spark hourly):
→ Features 1 hour stale → fraud pattern in 10 min not caught

Stream only (Flink):
→ Cannot compute "avg_prep_time over 3 months" in real-time
→ Flink state too large for long historical windows

Lambda combines both:
→ Flink: what happened in last 5 minutes
→ Spark: what happened over last 3 months
→ Model uses both = best accuracy

Alternative — Kappa Architecture (stream only):
→ Simpler but Flink state management complex for long windows
→ Choose Kappa if team is small and historical window < 1 day

Lambda Architecture ≠ AWS Lambda (serverless functions)
Lambda Architecture = design pattern coined by Nathan Marz 2011, named after λ
```

**Q3. Your ML model predictions are suddenly inaccurate. How do you debug?**
```
1. Feature freshness (most common):
   → Is Flink writing to Redis? Check Redis TTL on keys
   → Is Spark running? Check Airflow job status
   → Stale features = model predicts on old data

2. Feature drift:
   → Restaurant added items → avg_prep_time changed
   → Feature computation still uses old formula
   → Fix: monitor feature distribution over time

3. Model drift:
   → World changed (new city, lockdown)
   → Model trained on old patterns
   → Fix: retrain on recent data, monitor prediction accuracy

Immediate mitigation:
→ Fall back to rule-based prediction (avg_prep_time + distance/avg_speed)
→ Better than wrong ML prediction during debugging

Long term:
→ Feature monitoring (alert if distribution shifts)
→ Prediction monitoring (alert if avg prediction drifts)
→ Shadow mode: run new model alongside old before switching
```

**Q4. How do you ensure Feature Store stays consistent between Flink and Spark writes?**
```
Feature Store = system with 3 layers:
  Offline Store (S3)     → historical features for training, batch access
  Online Store (Redis)   → current features for inference, sub-ms access
  Feature Registry       → catalog of features, ownership, update frequency

Redis is ONLY the Online Store layer — not the entire Feature Store.

Flink and Spark write DIFFERENT keys — no conflict:
  Flink writes: restaurant:456:active_orders (TTL=2min, real-time)
  Spark writes: restaurant:456:avg_prep_time (TTL=2hr, historical)

Consistency risk — stale historical features:
  Acceptable: delivery time prediction (1 hour stale avg_prep_time = minor inaccuracy)
  NOT acceptable: fraud detection (stale txn_count = missed fraud)
  Fix for fraud: 15-min Spark interval OR Flink computes rolling avg too

TTL design is critical:
  Real-time features: short TTL (2min) — stale data is misleading
  Historical features: long TTL (2hr) — changes slowly, staleness acceptable
```

**Q5. PM wants prediction for 50M global users. How does design change?**
```
GB → PB scale. Three things change:

1. Feature Store (Redis → Redis Cluster or DynamoDB):
   → Partition features by user_id/restaurant_id across nodes
   → DynamoDB: managed, auto-scales, 10ms reads

2. ML Inference Service:
   → Single machine → auto-scaling fleet behind load balancer
   → Stateless (reads from Redis/DynamoDB) → easy horizontal scale

3. Feature pipelines:
   → Flink cluster (multiple machines, higher parallelism)
   → Spark on EMR/Databricks (distributed)

What stays the same:
   → Lambda Architecture pattern
   → CDC via Debezium
   → Kafka as central bus

Key insight: "Architecture pattern stays identical. What changes is scale configuration."
```

### Scenario 3 — GB + Real-time + Dashboards

**Q1. Design a dashboard system for ops team (live) and business team (historical).**
```
Two separate stacks on same Kafka:

Real-time ops stack:
Kafka → Flink (pre-aggregates every 30 sec) → ClickHouse → Grafana
- Flink writes: { city, orders_count, avg_delivery, payment_failures }
- ClickHouse answers in <10ms (50 pre-aggregated rows, not 25M raw events)
- Grafana auto-refreshes every 30 sec

Historical business stack:
Kafka → S3 (raw Parquet) → Spark (hourly clean + join) → Snowflake → Tableau
- Analysts write any SQL, explore freely
- Snowflake answers in 3-10 sec

Key: never use one tool for both.
ClickHouse cannot answer 3-month historical queries.
Snowflake cannot refresh every 30 sec reliably.
```

**Q2. Why not just use Snowflake for both dashboards?**
```
Snowflake real-time (Snowpipe) limitations:
- Minimum 1-2 min data freshness
- Cold query startup: 2-5 sec
- Shared warehouse: analyst heavy queries compete with dashboard
- Cost: per query compute billing

For 30-sec refresh ops dashboard:
- Snowflake cold query = 3-10 sec → dashboard always stale
- During sale with analysts running queries → contention → ops team blind

ClickHouse dedicated machine:
- Always warm, fixed $50/month, zero contention
- <10ms on pre-aggregated data
```

**Q3. Dashboard shows sudden order drop. Real issue or pipeline problem?**
```
Distinguish pipeline vs business issue first:

Step 1 — Check Kafka: is app still producing events?
→ No new events: app/database issue (real problem)
→ Events exist but dashboard shows drop: pipeline issue

Step 2 — Check Flink: running? consumer lag?
→ Flink stopped: dashboard shows stale data = pipeline issue

Step 3 — Check ClickHouse: when was last write?
→ Last write 10 min ago: Flink → ClickHouse broken

Step 4 — Cross-check PostgreSQL directly:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTES
→ PostgreSQL shows normal: pipeline issue, not business
→ PostgreSQL also shows drop: real business issue

Always add Grafana panel: "Pipeline health: last data received X seconds ago"
Ops team immediately knows if dashboard is stale.
```

**Q4. How would you design alerting on top of this dashboard?**
```
Two types of alerts:

Business alerts (ClickHouse → Grafana Alert):
→ orders_count < 100 in last 5 min during lunch peak → page oncall
→ payment_failure_rate > 5% last 10 min → page oncall

Pipeline health alerts:
→ last_clickhouse_write > 2 min ago → "Dashboard data stale"
→ Flink checkpoint failed → "Stream processing issue"
→ Kafka consumer lag > 100K messages → "Processing falling behind"

Alert routing:
Business alerts → ops team Slack + PagerDuty
Pipeline alerts → data engineering oncall

Leadership insight:
"Alert on business metrics AND pipeline health separately.
Business alert = orders broken.
Pipeline alert = data pipeline broken.
Conflating both = false alarms + missed incidents."
```

**Q5. Data scientist wants to run ML experiments on live data. How do you accommodate?**
```
Never let data scientists query ClickHouse directly.
ClickHouse is dedicated to ops dashboard — one heavy ML query = dashboard slows.

Option 1 — Snowflake (already exists):
→ Spark writes clean data to Snowflake hourly
→ Data scientist uses Snowflake for experiments
→ Zero impact on ClickHouse, 1-hour delay acceptable for experiments

Option 2 — S3 + Databricks notebook:
→ Raw data already in S3 from Kafka
→ Data scientist reads S3 via Databricks directly
→ No shared resources with production pipeline

Governance rule:
Ops dashboard  = ClickHouse (dedicated, no external access)
Analysts + DS  = Snowflake or S3
Production DB   = app only, no direct analytical access
```
