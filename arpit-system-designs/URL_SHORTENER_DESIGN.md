# URL Shortener System Design

**Author:** Arpit Jain  
**Target:** MAANG System Design Interview  
**Status:** Revision 1

## Revision 1: Initial Design

### 1. Functional Requirements

a) Generated short URLs should be collision free.

b) User should be able to provide a long URL and get short URL

c) Read:Write ratio is 9:1

---

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

a) System should support 100M URL creation per day

b) System should respond within 2 secs

c) uptime, collision free, latency

---

### 3. DB Choice and Tables Design, Storage Requirements

**Choice of DB:** Key value store - Cassandra or DynamoDB. DB should store longURL as key and ShortURL as value with created_on as timestamp.

**Storage Calculation:**
```
Daily write request: 100M per day => 100*1000000 requests
Each write request will take longURL (70bytes), short URL (20 bytes), created_on (10 bytes)
Approximately: 100 bytes per request
In a day: 10 GB storage
Per year: 3650 GB
For 5 years: 18TB
With 3x redundancy: 54TB total
```

---

### 4. APIs Design

API1 - `/createURL`

API2 - `/getLongURL`

---

### 5. Algorithm to Generate Unique ID - Batch Design to Manage Unique IDs

This has multiple faces:

**a) Generate short URLs and store in file:**

System needs to generate 100M short URLs everyday. Our approach is to use 62 chars (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) in all possible combinations for alpha numeric ID with length 6. This can generate 62^6 (~56 Billion) unique URLs. To randomise/shuffle, unix sort job can be used and output containing these 56B IDs can be written in set of files. Each ID will require 6 bytes and to write 56B IDs, it will require 360GB size of files. IDs can be written in a file of 1 GB each and these files can be stored in Cloud buckets like AWS S3.

**b) Loading short URLs:**

Load these IDs from each of the S3 files to Kafka via a publisher (Python/Java program), Spark can be used to load all these files parallely and load to multiple kafka partitions for faster loading.

---

### 6. Logical Block Architecture

**a) Batch design to manage unique IDs:**

![Batch Design Diagram](./diagrams/batch-design-diagram.png)

*Diagram: Python program generates 56B IDs in 360 files (1GB each) → Store in S3 → Spark loads and shuffles via Unix sort → Reload to S3 → Load with Spark → Load into Kafka partitions → Ready to map*

**b) User request to convert long to short and redirect short URL to long URL:**

![User Request Flow Diagram](./diagrams/user-request-flow-diagram.png)

*Diagram: User → API Gateway → Load Balancer → splits into Write path (Create Short URLs App Server) and Read path (Redirect Short URL to Long URL App Server) → NoSQL Database (Cassandra/DynamoDB) and Cache (Redis) and Kafka*

## Feedback on Revision 1

### ✅ Strengths

| Aspect | Your Approach | Assessment |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Batch pre-generation | Sequential generation → shuffle → Kafka | Excellent! Avoids collisions and DB bottleneck |
| Capacity planning | 100 bytes/entry × 100M/day = 10GB/day = 54TB (5yr, 3x redundancy) | Math is correct ✓ |
| NoSQL choice | Cassandra or DynamoDB | Good for key-value workload ✓ |
| Architecture | Microservices on Kubernetes | Scalable design ✓ |
| Components | API Gateway, Load Balancer, Cache, DB, Kafka | All essential parts present ✓ |

### ❌ Critical Gaps (Missing for MAANG Interview)

| # | Gap | Why It Matters | Add to Next Revision |
|---|-----|---|---|
| 1 | **Code length decision (62^6 = 56B)** | 56B only covers 1.8 years at 100M/day. Interviewer asks "then what?" | Justify 6 chars OR upgrade to 62^7 (3.5T = 96 years). Plan for regeneration at 80% |
| 2 | **Cache strategy missing** | 9:1 read ratio demands caching! No TTL, hit rate, or layer strategy mentioned | Redis with LRU, 1-hour TTL, 99% hit target, multi-layer (browser→CDN→Redis→DB) |
| 3 | **Rate limiting not detailed** | No protection against abuse (100M URLs in 1 day from 1 user?) | API Gateway: 100 URLs/hour/IP, return 429 if exceeded |
| 4 | **No deduplication logic** | If User A and B shorten same URL, do they get different codes? | Check if long_url exists BEFORE assigning code |
| 5 | **301 vs 302 trade-off missing** | Classic MAANG question: which redirect type? Why? | Use 302 (track analytics). Explain why cache layer makes load acceptable |
| 6 | **Failure handling absent** | What if Kafka fails? Batch crashes? Cache down? | Add recovery plans: Kafka replicas, idempotent batch, DB fallback |
| 7 | **Sharding strategy unclear** | How to scale DB horizontally when codes run out? | Shard by short_url first character → distribute across nodes |
| 8 | **Monitoring/alerting missing** | No mention of KPIs, thresholds, or exhaustion alerts | Monitor queue depth, alert at 80%, trigger regeneration |
| 9 | **Batch job details vague** | How long does generation take? What if shuffle fails? | Specify SLA (6-10 hours), checkpoint for restarts, monitoring |
| 10 | **API specs incomplete** | Only endpoint names mentioned | Full specs: request/response format, error codes (400, 404, 429), headers |

### Summary Score

| Aspect | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Requirements understanding | A | Clear ✓ |
| Batch pre-generation | A | Solid approach ✓ |
| Diagrams & architecture | A | Good layout ✓ |
| Capacity math | A | Correct ✓ |
| Database & storage | A | Appropriate ✓ |
| **Caching strategy** | D | Only mentioned, not detailed |
| **Rate limiting** | D | Not explained |
| **Code length justification** | D | No reasoning given |
| **Deduplication** | D | Missing entirely |
| **301 vs 302** | F | Not discussed |

**Overall: 65-70% for MAANG → 85-90% with fixes**
